In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.	Ohapu oya li ko, manga uuyuni inaau shitwa. Ohapu oya li Kalunga nOhapu oya li Kalunga.
The same was in the beginning with God.	Okuza ketamekolela Ohapu oya li puKalunga.
All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.	Kalunga okwe mu shititha iinima ayihe, nokaku na nando oshinima shimwe shomeshito inaashi shitwa kee po.
In him was life; and the life was the light of men.	Ohapu oya li yi na omwenyo, nomwenyo ogwa ningi uuyelele waantu.
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.	Uuyelele mbuka owa minikile momilema, nomilema inadhi u dhima po.
There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.	Okwa li ku na omulumentu a tumwa kuKalunga, edhina lye Johannes.
The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.	Oye okwe ya, a hokololele aantu uuyelele, opo ayehe yi itaalithwe kuye.
He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.	Haye mwene a li uuyelele, ihe okwe ya, a hokolole uuyelele.
That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.	Uuyelele mbuka washili otau ya muuyuni, u minikile omuntu kehe.
He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.	Ohapu okwa li muuyuni, naKalunga okwe mu shititha uuyuni, ihe uuyuni inau mu dhimbulula.
He came unto his own, and his own received him not.	Oye okwe ya kumboka yaandjawo, naamboka yaandjawo inaye mu taamba.
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:	Ihe ayehe mboka ye mu taamba noye mu itaale, okwe ya pe oonkondo, ya ninge aana yaKalunga.
Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.	Oyo inaa valwa pamukalo gwopanshitwe, nokutya kaye shi oluvalo lwomuntu, ihe oya valwa muKalunga.
And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.	Ohapu nokwa ningi omuntu nokwa kala mokati ketu. Otse otwa tala eadhimo lye, eadhimo lyomuvalwa awike gwaHe. Oye okwa li u udha esilohenda noshili.
John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.	Johannes okwe mu hokolola nokwi igidha a ti: “Nguka oye naanaa ngoka nde mu popile nda ti: ‘Ngoka te ya konima yandje, okwa li ndje komeho, oshoka okwa li ko, manga ngame nda li ndaa ko.’ ”
And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.	Nomowindji wesilohenda lye tseni atuheni otwa pewa mo esilohenda lya gwedhele kesilohenda.
For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.	Oshoka ompango Kalunga okwe yi gandja ya pitile muMoses, ihe esilohenda noshili oye etwa kuJesus Kristus.
No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.	Kaku na omuntu a mono Kalunga nando olumwe, ihe Kalunga Omuvalwa awike ngoka e li puHe, oye e mu holola.
And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?	Ndika olyo ehokololo lyaJohannes, Aajuda yomuJerusalem sho ya tumu kuye aayambi nAalevi oku mu pula: “Ongoye lye?”
And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.	Johannes ina tinda okuyamukula, ihe okwa hempulula sha yela a ti: “Hangame Kristus.”
And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.	Oyo noye mu pula: “Ongoye lye ano? Ongoye Elia?” Oye okwa ti: “Aawe, hangame!” “Ongoye omuhunganeki?” Oye okwa yamukula. “Aawe.”
Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?	Oyo noya ti kuye: “Ongoye lye ano, opo tu fale eyamukulo kumboka ye tu tumu. Ngoye oto itile ngiini?”
He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.	Johannes okwa yamukula noohapu dhomuhunganeki Jesaja a ti: “Ongame ewi lyanakwiigidha mombuga tali ti: ‘Yelekanithileni Omuwa ondjila.’ ”
And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.	Aatumwa mboka oya li yomaafarisayi.
And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?	Oyo noya pula Johannes ya ti: “Omolwashike ano to shasha, ngele hangoye Kristus nenge Elia nenge omuhunganeki?”
John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;	Johannes okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Ngame otandi mu shasha nomeya, ihe mokati keni omwa thikama ngoka ne kaamu mu shi.
He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.	Ngoka te ya konima yandje, oye tuu ngoka inaandi gwana okudhitula omiya dhoongaku dhe.”
These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.	Iinima mbika oya ningilwa muBetania handiyaka yomulonga gwaJordan, nkoka Johannes a li ta shasha aantu.
The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.	Esiku lya landula Johannes okwa mono Jesus te ya kuye nokwa ti: “Tala, Onzigona yaKalunga, tayi kutha po oondjo dhuuyuni!
This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.	Ngoka oye naanaa ngoka nde mu popile nda ti: ‘Omulumentu te ya konima yandje, oye omunene, oshoka okwa li ko, manga ngame nda li ndaa ko.’
And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.	Ngame onda li kaandi mu shi, ihe onde ya okushasha nomeya, opo a tseyithilwe Aaisraeli.”
And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.	Johannes okwe mu hokolola a ti: “Onda mono Ombepo ya kuluka megulu ya fa onguti noye mu lambele.
And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.	Ngame nonda li kaandi mu shi, ihe Kalunga, ngoka a tumu ndje okushasha nomeya, okwa lombwele ndje a ti: ‘Ngoka to mu mono ta lambelwa kOmbepo notayi kala kombanda ye, oye ngoka ta shasha nOmbepo Ondjapuki.’
And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.	Ngame onde shi mono notandi mu hokololele nokutya oye Omuna gwaKalunga.”
Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;	Esiku lya landula Johannes okwa li ko ishewe a thikama nayaali yomaalongwa ye.
And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!	Johannes sho a mono Jesus te ende po, okwa ti: “Tala, Onzigona yaKalunga.”
And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.	Aalongwa ye yaali oye mu uvu, sho ta popi ngaaka noya landula Jesus.
Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?	Nena Jesus okwa punguluka nokwe ya mono, sho taye mu landula, nokwa pula: “Otamu kongo shike?” Oyo oye mu yamukula: “Owa kala peni, Rabbi?” (Oshitya shika otashi ti “Muhongi.”)
He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.	Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Ileni, mu tale!” Oyo sho ya yi naye, oya mono mpoka a kala noya kala puye oshihupe shesiku ndyoka. Otundi oya li ontine yokomatango.
One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.	Gumwe gwomaalongwa mbeyaka yaali mboka ya li yu uvu Johannes sho a popi noya landula Jesus, oAndreas, omumwayina gwaSimon.
He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.	Andreas okwa tsakaneke tangotango omumwayina Simon nokwe mu lombwele a ti: “Tse otwa mono Omugwayekwa” (Oshitya shika otashi ti “Kristus.”)
And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.	Ye okwa fala Simon kuJesus. Jesus okwe mu tala nokwa ti: “Ongoye Simon yaJohannes; oto ki ithanwa Kefas,” (kokutya Petrus ndyoka tali ti “emanya”.)
The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.	Esiku lya landula Jesus okwa li a hala okuya kuGalilea. Okwa tsakaneke Filippus nokwa ti kuye: “Landula ndje.”
Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.	Filippus okwa li Omubetsaida, oshilando moka Andreas naPetrus ya kala mo.
Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.	Filippus okwa tsakaneke Natanael nokwa ti kuye: “Tse otwa mono omulumentu ngoka a nyolwa kuMoses membo lyompango nokaahunganeki. Oye Jesus, omuna gwaJosef Omunasareti.”
And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.	Natanael okwe mu pula a ti: “MuNasaret otamu vulu tuu okuza uuwanawa washa?” Filippus okwe mu lombwele. “Ila, u tale!”
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!	Jesus okwa mono Natanael te ya kuye nokwe mu popi a ti: “Tala, Omwiisraeli gwashili, ngoka kee na nando iifundja!”
Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.	Natanael okwe mu pula a ti: “Owa tseya ndje ngiini?” Jesus okwa ti: “Onde ku mono, sho wa li momukwiyu, manga Filippus inee ku ithana.”
Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.	Natanael okwe mu yamukula a ti: “Muhongi, ongoye Omuna gwaKalunga! Ongoye Omukwaniilwa gwAaisraeli!”
Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.	Jesus okwe mu yamukula a ti: “Ngoye ndishi owi itaale owala, sho nde ku lombwele kutya onde ku mono, sho wa li momukwiyu? Oto ka mona iinima iinene yi vule mbika.”
And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.	Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Otamu ka mona egulu lye eguluka, naayengeli yaKalunga taa londo notaa kulukile kOmuna gwOmuntu.”
And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:	Sho pwa piti omasiku gatatu, okwa li ku na ohango muKana, oshilando shomuGalilea. Yina yaJesus oko a li.
And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.	Jesus naalongwa ye oya li wo ya hiywa kohango.
And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.	Omaviinu agehe sho ga pu po, yina yaJesus okwa ti kuye: “Kaye na omaviinu.”
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.	Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Ino kala u na oshimpwiyu nangame, meme. Ethimbo lyandje inali thika natango.”
His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.	Yina yaJesus okwa lombwele aayakuli a ti: “Shaa shoka te mu lombwele, shi ningeni.”
And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.	Pamukalo gwokuyoga kwAajuda okwa li ku na iiyuma ihamano yomamanya popepi. Oshuma kehe oshi thike pomayemele gahetatu nenge omulongo nagaali.
Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.	Jesus okwa lombwele aayakuli a ti: “Tekeleni iiyuma omeya, yu udhe.” Oyo noye yi tekele yu udhilila sigo okomilungu.
And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.	Ye okwa ti kuyo: “Ngashingeyi ga pimpii mo ihe, mu ga faalele omuyakuli omukuluntu gwaayenda.” Oyo noye ge mu faalele.
When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,	Omuyakuli omukuluntu sho a makele omeya ngoka ga shituka omaviinu, okwa li kee shi mpoka ga zi. Aayakuli mboka ya teke omeya, oyo ayeke ya li ye shi shi. Omuyakuli omukuluntu okwi ithana ihe ombushiki
And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.	nokwa ti kuye: “Omuntu kehe oha gandja tango omaviinu ngoka omatoye, opo ihe ngele aantu ya kolwa, ote ya pe ngoka omawinayi. Ihe ngoye sigo oompaka owa holeke omaviinu omatoye.”
This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.	Oshikumithalonga shika shotango Jesus okwe shi ningile muKana, oshilando shomuGalilea. Okwa holola eadhimo lye, aalongwa ye noye mu itaale.
After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.	Konima yoshiningwanima shika Jesus mwene nayina naamwayina aalumentu naalongwa ye oya yi kuKapernaum noya kala ko omasiku gamwe.
And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.	Opaasa yAajuda sho ya li popepi, Jesus okwa yi kuJerusalem.
And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:	Okwa adha aantu motempeli taa landitha oongombe, oonzi noonguti, naapingakanithi yiimaliwa ya kuutumba piitaafula yawo.
And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;	Okwa tungu ongola yepando nokwe ya tidha mo ayehe motempeli pamwe noongombe noonzi dhawo. Okwa tilehi iimaliwa, niitaafula yawo okwe yi undulile pevi.
And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.	Aalandithi yoonguti okwe ya lombwele a ti: “Kuthii mo iinima mbika ayihe! Ongulu yaTate inamu yi ninga oshilandelo.”
And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.	Aalongwa ye oya dhimbulukwa kutya enyolo otali ti: “Uulaadhi omolwongulu yoye, Kalunga, otau li ndje.”
Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?	Aajuda oya pula Jesus ya ti: “Oshikumithalonga oshini po to longo, u tu ulukile kutya ou na epitikilo okulonga ngeyi?”
Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.	Jesus okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Kumunii po otempeli ndjika, ngame notandi yi tungulula momasiku gatatu.”
Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?	Nena Aajuda oye mu lombwele: “Otempeli ndjika oya tungwa oomvula omilongo ne nahamano, ongoye noto yi tungulula momasiku gatatu?”
But he spake of the temple of his body.	Ihe otempeli ndjoka Jesus a popi, oyo olutu lwe.
When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.	Ano Jesus sho a yumudhwa kuusi, aalongwa ye oya dhimbulukwa oohapu ndhoka a li a popi. Oyo noyi itaale enyolo noohapu ndhoka Jesus e dhi ya lombwele.
Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.	Jesus sho a li muJerusalem pethimbo lyoshituthi shOpaasa, aantu oyendji oya mono iikumithalonga mbyoka a longo noye mu itaale.
But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,	Ihe ye ini iholola kuyo, oshoka ye mwene okwa li e ya shi ayehe.
And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.	Ye ina pumbwa omuntu e mu hokololele sha kombinga yomuntu, oshoka okwa tseya ye mwene shoka shi li momuntu.
There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:	Gumwe gwomaafarisayi, edhina lye Nikodemus, oshilyo shomongundu yaapangeli Aajuda,
The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.	okwe ya kuJesus uusiku nokwa ti kuye: “Muhongi, otu shi shi, ongoye omulongi ngoka a tumwa kuKalunga, oshoka kaku na nando ogumwe ta vulu okulonga iikumithalonga mbyoka to longo, okuninga Kalunga e li pamwe naye.”
Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.	Jesus okwe mu yamukula nokwa ti: “Ngame otandi ku lombwele oshili: Omuntu ngele ita valululwa, ita vulu okumona Oshilongo shaKalunga.”
Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?	Nikodemus okwa ti kuye: “Omuntu ngele omukuluntu, ota vulu ngiini okuvalwa ishewe? Ita vulu ndishi okushuna moshivalelo shayina, a valwe olutiyali?”
Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.	Jesus okwe mu yamukula: “Ngame otandi ku lombwele oshili: Kape na omuntu ta vulu okuya mOshilongo shaKalunga, ngele ina valululwa momeya nomOmbepo.
That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.	Shoka sha valwa panyama, osho onyama, naashoka sha valwa pambepo, osho Ombepo.
Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.	Ino kumwa, sho nde ku lombwele kutya omu na okuvalululwa.
The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.	Ano ombepo ohayi pepe shaa mpoka ya hala. Oto uvu oshihomo shayo, ihe ku shi mpoka tayi zi naankoka yu uka. Osho naanaa shi li kukehe ngoka a valwa pambepo.”
Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?	Nikodemus okwe mu pula a ti: “Shika otashi vulika ngiini?”
Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?	Jesus okwa yamukula a ti: “Ngoye omulongi gwAaisraeli, ihe nani shika ku shi shi?
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.	Otandi ku lombwele oshili. Tse otatu popi shoka tu shi shi notatu hokolola shoka twa mona, ihe ne inamu hala okutaamba ehokololo lyetu.
If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?	Ngele tandi mu lombwele iinima yokombanda yevi, ihe itamu itaale, otamu vulu ngiini okwiitaala, ngele tandi mu hokololele iinima yomegulu?
And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.	Kape na nando ogumwe a yile megulu kakele kOmuna gwOmuntu, ngoka a zi megulu.”
And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:	“Ngashika naanaa Moses a li a yelutha eyoka pombanda mombuga, osho wo Omuna gwOmuntu e na oku ka yeluthwa pombanda,
That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.	opo kehe ngoka te mu itaale, a kale e na omwenyo gwaaluhe.
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.	Oshoka osho ngeyi Kalunga a kala e hole uuyuni, oye a gandja Omwana awike, opo shaa ngoka te mu itaale, kaa kane, ihe a kale e na omwenyo gwaaluhe.
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.	Oshoka Kalunga ina tuma Omwana muuyuni, a pangule uuyuni, aawe, okwe mu tumu, opo uuyuni u hupithwe kuye.”
He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.	“Ngoka i itaala Omwana, ita pangulwa; ngoka ini itaala, okwa pangulwa nale, oshoka ini itaala Omuvalwa awike gwaKalunga.
And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.	Ihe epangulo oli li mpoka kutya uuyelele owe ya muuyuni, ihe aantu oye hole omilema shi vulithe pokuhola uuyelele, oshoka iilonga yawo iiwinayi.
For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.	Kehe ngoka ha longo uuwinayi, oku tonde uuyelele noite ya puuyelele, oshoka ina hala, iilonga ye iiwinayi yi holoke.
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.	Ihe ngoka ta longo iilonga yu uka, ote ya puuyelele, opo uuyelele u holole kutya iilonga ye oya longwa omolwokuvulika kuKalunga.”
After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.	Konima yaambika Jesus naalongwa ye oya yi kuJudea. Ye okwa kala ko omasiku gamwe pamwe nayo ta shasha aantu.
And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.	Johannes okwa li ta shasha puAinon, popepi naSalim, oshoka kokuma nkoka okwa li ku na omeya ogendji. Aantu oyendji oye ya kuJohannes, oye nokwe ya shasha,
For John was not yet cast into prison.	oshoka Johannes okwa li ine edhililwa natango mondholongo.
Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.	Yamwe yomaalongwa yaJohannes oya tameke okuludhika nOmujuda gumwe kombinga yeyogo lyopaShijuda.
And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.	Yo oye ya kuJohannes noya ti kuye: “Muhongi, tala ko, omulumentu ngoka a li pamwe nangoye handiyaka yomulonga gwaJordan naangoka we mu hokolola, ota shasha, naantu ayehe otaa yi kuye.”
John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.	Johannes okwa yamukula a ti: “Kape na omuntu ta vulu okwiikuthila nando osha, okuninga Kalunga te shi mu pe.
Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.	One yene oonzapo dhandje, sho nda tile, ngame kandi shi Kristus, ihe onda tumwa oku mu tetekela.
He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.	Ngoka e na omufuko, oye ombushiki. Ihe kuume kombushiki ota thikama e ta pulakene nota nyanyukilwa ewi lyombushiki. Osho wo nenyanyu ndika lyandje olya gwanenena.
He must increase, but I must decrease.	Oye e na okunenepala, ihe ngame ondi na okushonopala.”
He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.	“Oongoka a za pombanda, oye omunene e vule ayehe. Ngoka gwopavi, ogwopavi nota popi iinima yopavi. Ngoka a za megulu, oye omunene e vule ayehe.
And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.	Oye ta hokolola shoka a mono nokwa uvu, ihe kape na nando ogumwe ta taamba ehokololo lye.
He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.	Oongoka ta taamba ehokololo lye, ota koleke nokutya Kalunga oye Kalunga kashili.
For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.	Ngoka a tumwa kuKalunga, oye ta popi oohapu dhaKalunga; oshoka Kalunga ite mu pe Ombepo ta yeleke, ihe ote mu pe sha gwana.
The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.	He oku hole Omwana nokwe mu pa iinima ayihe miikaha ye.
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.	Oongoka i itaala Omwana, oku na omwenyo gwaaluhe, ihe ngoka itaa vulika kOmwana, ita ka mona omwenyo, ihe ondjahi yaKalunga otayi kala kombanda ye.”
When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,	Aafarisayi oyu uvu kutya Jesus okwa likola nokwa shasha aalongwa oyendji ye vule mboka yaJohannes.
(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)	Nonando Jesus mwene ina shasha nando omuntu gumwe, ihe aalongwa ye oyo ya shasha.
He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.	Jesus sho u uvu shoka tashi tiwa kaantu, okwa thigi po Judea nokwa shuna kuGalilea.
And he must needs go through Samaria.	Mondjila ye yokuya nkoka okwa li e na okupitila muSamaria.
Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.	Oye nokwe ya koshilando shomuSamaria, edhina lyasho Sikar, shi li popepi nepya ndyoka Jakob a pele omwana Josef.
Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.	Popepi nepya ndyoka opwa li pu na oluthithiya lwaJakob. Jesus okwa li a vulithwa kondjila nokwa kuutumba pomuthima. Otundi oya li lwopomulongo nambali yomutenya.
There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.	Omukiintu Omusamaria okwe ya komuthima okuteka omeya. Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Pe ndje wo, ndi nwe mo.”
(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)	Aalongwa ye oya adhika ya ya koshilando, ya ka landa iikulya.
Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.	Omukiintu Omusamaria okwa yamukula: “Ngoye Omujuda, ihe ngame omukiintu Omusamaria. Oto vulu tuu okwiindila ndje, ndi ku pe, u nwe?” Oshoka Aajuda nAasamaria ihaa endathana.
Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.	Jesus okwa yamukula a ti: “Ando owa li wa tseya shoka Kalunga ha gandja naanguka olye te ku indile omeya, ando ngoye owe mu indile, e ku pe omeya omanamwenyo.”
The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?	Omukiintu okwa ti kuye: “Omuwa, ngoye ku na nando oshitekitho nomuthima omule. Omeya omanamwenyo oto ga adha peni?
Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?	Ngoye omunene nani u vule tatekulu Jakob, ngoka e tu pa omuthima nguno nokwa li ha nu mo ye mwene pamwe noyana niimuna ye?”
Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:	Jesus okwe mu yamukula a ti: “Kehe ngoka ta nu omeya ngaka, ota ka sa enota natango.
But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.	Ihe shaa ngoka ta nu omeya ngoka tandi ge mu pe, oye ita ka sa we enota sigo aluhe. Oshoka omeya ngoka tandi ge mu pe, otaga ka ninga muye oluthithiya lwomeya taga fuluka sigo omomwenyo gwaaluhe.”
The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.	Omukiintu okwa ti kuye: “Omuwa, pe ndje wo omeya ngoka, opo ndaa se we enota, ngame kaandi ye we nkuka komuthima okuteka.”
Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.	Jesus okwe mu lombwele: “Inda, u ki ithane omulumentu gwoye, ngoye u ye naye nkuka.”
The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:	Omukiintu okwe mu yamukula a ti: “Kandi na omulumentu.” Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Owa popi dhoshili kutya ku na omulumentu.
For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.	Oshoka ngoye owa li u na aalumentu yatano, naangoka u na ngashingeyi, ke shi omulumentu gwoye. Moshinima shoka owa popi dhoshili.”
The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.	Omukiintu okwa ti kuye: “Omuwa, ondi ku wete kutya ngoye omuhunganeki.
Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.	Ootatekulu Aasamaria oya li haa galikana Kalunga kondundu ndjika, ihe ne Aajuda ohamu ti kutya Jerusalem olyo ehala moka tu na okugalikanena.”
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.	Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Nekulu, itaala ndje. Ethimbo otali ya, uuna ndoka itaamu ka galikana Tate kondundu ndjika nenge muJerusalem.
Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.	Ne Aasamaria omu shi tuu ngoka hamu mu galikana? Tse Aajuda otu shi ngoka hatu mu galikana, oshoka ehupitho otali zi mAajuda.
But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.	Ihe ethimbo otali ya noli li po ngashingeyi, uuna aagalikani yashili taa ka galikana Tate mOmbepo nomoshili. Oshoka aagalikani ya tya ngaaka oyo naanaa mboka Tate e ya hala.
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.	Kalunga oye Ombepo, onkee naamboka taye mu galikana, oye na okugalikana mOmbepo nomoshili.”
The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.	Omukiintu okwa ti kuye: “Ondi shi shi kutya Kristus, nokutya Omugwayekwa ote ke ya. Nge te ya, ote ke tu lombwela iinima ayihe.”
Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.	Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Ongame naanaa nguka te popi nangoye.”
And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?	Pethimbo olyo tuu ndyoka aalongwa ye oye ya. Oya kumwa, sho ya mono Jesus ta popi nomukiintu ngoka. Ihe kapwa li nando ogumwe e mu pula: “Owa hala shike?” nenge: “Omolwashike to popi naye?”
The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,	Omukiintu okwa thigi po ihe oshuma she nokwa yi koshilando. Okwa lombwele aantu:
Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?	“Ileni, mu tale omulumentu ngoka a lombwele ndje ayihe nde yi ninga. Pamwe oye Kristus?”
Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.	Oyo oya zi mo moshilando noye ya kuJesus.
In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.	Aalongwa oya kala taa lombwele Jesus taa ti: “Muhongi, lya.”
But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.	Ihe Ye okwa yamukula a ti: “Ngame ondi na iikulya mbyoka kaamu yi shi.”
Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?	Aalongwa ye oya pulathana ihe: “Pamwe ope na ngoka e mu etele iikulya?”
Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.	Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Iikulya yandje oyo okulonga ehalo lyaanguka a tumu ndje nokutsakanitha oshilonga shoka e shi pe ndje.
Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.	“Ne ohamu ti: ‘Oku na natango oomwedhi ne, eteyo li thike.’ Ngame otandi mu lombwele: Yelutheni omeho geni, mu tale kutya omapya oga thika okuteywa.
And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.	Ngashingeyi nokuli omuteyi ota taamba ondjambi ye niilya ote yi pungulile momwenyo gwaaluhe, opo omukuni a nyanyukwe pamwe nomuteyi.
And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.	Oshoka moshinima shika ohapu oya tsa kutya: ‘Omukuni okwi ili nomuteyi okwi ili.’
I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.	Ngame onde mu tumu okuteya mpoka inaamu longa po. Yalwe oyo ya longo, ne nomwe ya okulya iiyimati yiilonga yawo.”
And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.	Oyendji yomAasamaria yomoshilando shoka oyi itaale Jesus omolwoohapu dhomukiintu, ngoka a ti: “Oye okwa lombwele ndje iinima ayihe mbyoka nde yi ninga.”
So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.	Aasamaria sho ye ya kuye, oye mu indile, a menekele puyo. Ye okwa menekele puyo omasiku gaali.
And many more believed because of his own word;	Aantu oyendji ye vule mboka yotango oyi itaale Jesus omolwoohapu dhe mwene.
And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.	Yo noya lombwele omukiintu: “Tse otwi itaala, hamolwoohapu dhoye, ihe omolwashoka twe mu uvu tse yene notu shi shi, oye lela omuhupithi guuyuni.”
Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.	Omasiku ngoka gaali sho ga piti po, Jesus okwa zi ko nkoka nokwa yi kuGalilea.
For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.	Oshoka Jesus mwene okwa ti: “Omuhunganeki iha simanekwa moshilongo shaandjawo.”
Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.	Ano Jesus sho a thiki kuGalilea, Aagalilea oye mu taamba, oshoka nayo wo oya li moshituthi shOpaasa muJerusalem noya mono ashihe shoka a ningi pethimbo lyoshituthi.
So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.	Jesus okwe ya ishewe muKana, oshilando shomuGalilea, moka a li a shitukitha omeya ga ninge omaviinu. MuKapernaum omwa li mu na elenga lyontumba lyomukwaniilwa li na omwana omumati ta alukwa.
When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.	Sho lya kundana kutya Jesus okwa zi ko kuJudea e ya kuGalilea, olya yi kuye oku mu indila, e ye kuKapernaum, a aludhe omwana, oshoka okwa li e li pokusa.
Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.	Jesus okwe mu lombwele a ti: “Ngele itamu mono iikumithalonga niilongankondo, itamu itaale.”
The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.	Elenga olya ti kuye: “Omuwa, ila, manga omumwandje inaa sa!”
Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.	Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Inda, omumwoye oku na omwenyo.” Omulumentu okwi itaale oohapu dhaJesus e dhi mu lombwele nokwa yi.
And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.	Mondjila ye yokushuna kegumbo aamati ye oye mu tsakaneke noye mu lombwele kutya omwana oku na omwenyo.
Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.	Okwe ya pula ethimbo, uuna a tameke okukala nawa. Yo oya ti kuye: “Ohela potundi yotango yomutenya olwiidhi olwe mu etha po.”
So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.	He okwa dhimbulukwa kutya opotundi naanaa ndjoka Jesus e mu lombwele a ti: “Omumwoye oku na omwenyo.” Oye nokwi itaale pamwe negumbo lye alihe.
This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.	Oshikumithalonga shika osho oshitiyali shoka Jesus a ningi, sho a zi kuJudea e te ya kuGalilea.
After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.	Konima yaambika okwa li ku na oshituthi shAajuda. Jesus okwa yi kuJerusalem.
Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.	Ano muJerusalem posheelo shoonzi opwa li pu na edhiya hali ithanwa Betesda mOshihebeli noli na oondunda ntano.
In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.	Moondunda ndhoka omwa li mwa lala ongundu onene yaavu: aaposi, iilema niitiningili. Aavu mbaka oya li ya tegelela, omeya ga nyenganyengithwe.
For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.	Oshoka pomathimbo nomathimbo omuyengeli gwOmuwa oha kulukile medhiya e ta nyenganyengitha omeya. Omuvu ngoka ta thiki tango medhiya, omeya sho ga nyenganyengithwa, ota aluka kuuvu kehe kwa li e u na.
And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.	Okwa li ku na omulumentu gumwe a li a ala oomvula omilongo ndatu nahetatu.
When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?	Jesus sho e mu mono a lala, okwa li e shi shi kutya omulumentu ngoka okwa ala ethimbo ele. Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Owa hala okwaaluka?”
The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.	Omuvu okwa yamukula: “Omuwa, kandi na ngoka ta fala ndje medhiya, uuna omeya taga nyenganyengithwa. Olwindji manga tandi kambadhala okuya mo, mukwetu gulwe ta tetekele ndje okuthika mo.”
Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.	Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Thikama, kutha ontala yoye, ngu u ende.”
And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.	Mbalambala omulumentu okwa aluka. Ye okwa kutha po ontala ye nokwa yi. Oshinima shika osha ningwa mesiku lyEsabati.
The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.	Onkee Aajuda oya lombwele omulumentu ngoka a aludhwa ya ti: “Nena esiku lyEsabati, nompango itayi ku pitikile, u humbate ontala yoye.”
He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.	Ye okwe ya yamukula: “Omulumentu ngoka a aludha ndje, oye a lombwele ndje: ‘Kutha ontala yoye, ngu u ye.’ ”
Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?	Oyo oye mu pula: “Omulumentu olye ngono e ku lombwele kutya: ‘Kutha ontala yoye, ngu u ye?’ ”
And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.	Ihe omwaaludhwa okwa li inee mu tseya oye olye, oshoka Jesus okwa adhika a ya nale nomolwashoka wo opwa li pu na aantu oyendji.
Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.	Konima yethimbo Jesus okwe mu mono motempeli nokwa ti kuye: “Tala, ngashingeyi owa aluka. Ino yona we, opo waa adhike kuuwinayi u vule mbuka.”
The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.	Omulumentu okwa yi nokwa hokololele Aajuda kutya oJesus e mu aludha.
And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.	Omolwoshinima shika Aajuda oya tameke okutidhagana Jesus, oshoka okwa aludha omuntu mEsabati.
But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.	Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Tate ota longo aluhe, nangame wo ondi na okulonga.”
Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.	Omolwoohapu ndhika Aajuda oya tokola oku mu dhipaga, oshoka oye ina yona ashike Esabati, ihe okwa ti wo kutya Kalunga Oye He. Osho ngeyi okwi iningi e thike puKalunga.
Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.	Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Omwana ita vulu okuninga nando osha muye mwene. Ota longo owala shoka e wete He ta ningi. Shoka He ta longo, osho wo Omwana ta ningi.
For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.	Oshoka He oku hole Omwana note mu ulukile iinima ayihe mbyoka ye mwene ta longo. Ye note ke mu ulukila iilonga iinene yi vule mbika, opo mu kumwe.
For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.	Oshoka ngashika naanaa He ta yumudha aasi nota gandja omwenyo, osho wo Omwana ta gandja omwenyo kumboka a hala.
For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:	He ita pangula nando ogumwe, ihe epangulo alihe okwe li gandja kOmwana,
That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.	aantu ayehe opo ya simaneke Omwana, ngashika naanaa taa simaneke He. Oongoka itaa simaneke Omwana, ita vulu wo okusimaneka He, ngoka e mu tuma.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.	“Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: ngoka tu uvu oohapu dhandje noti itaale ngoka a tuma ndje, oku na omwenyo gwaaluhe. Ita pangulwa we, ihe okwa za mo nale meso nokwe ya momwenyo.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.	Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Ethimbo otali ke ya nolye ya nale nokuli, uuna oonakusa taa ka uva ewi lyOmuna gwaKalunga. Ayehe mboka taye li uvu, otaa ka kala ye na omwenyo.
For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;	Oshoka ngashika naanaa He e li po oluthithiya lwomwenyo muye mwene, osho wo okwa pe Omwana oonkondo, a kale oluthithiya lwomwenyo muye mwene.
And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.	Okwa pe Omwana oonkondo dhokupangula, oshoka Omwana oye Omuna gwOmuntu.
Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,	Inamu kuminwa oshinima shika; oshoka ethimbo otali ya, uuna oonakusa ayehe mboka ye li moombila, taa ka uva ewi lye.
And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.	Yo notaa ka za mo moombila dhawo: mboka ya longo uuwanawa, otaa ka yumudhwa e taa kala ye na omwenyo, naamboka ya longo uuwinayi, otaa ka yumudhwa e taa ka pangulwa.”
I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.	“Ngame itandi vulu okuninga nando osha mungame mwene. Otandi pangula owala ngaashi Kalunga a lombwele ndje, nepangulo lyandje oli li mondjila. Oshoka itandi landula ehalo lyandje mwene, ihe olyaanguka a tuma ndje.”
If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.	“Ngele otandi ihokolola mwene, nena ehokololo lyandje kali shi okwiinekelwa.
There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.	Ihe oku na gulwe ngoka ta hokolola ndje. Ngame nondi shi shi kutya ehokololo ndyoka ta hokolola ndje, olyoshili.
Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.	Ne omwa tumine aatumwa yeni kuJohannes, nokwa hokolola oshili.
But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.	Ngame itandi taamba ehokololo lyomuntu, ihe otandi popi ngeyi, opo mu hupithwe.
He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.	Johannes okwa li olamba ya tema notayi minikile, ihe ne omwa li mwa hala okunyanyukilwa muuyelele we okathimbo okafupi kowala.
But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.	Ihe ngame ondi na ehokololo enene li vule ndiyaka lyaJohannes: iilonga mbyoka tandi yi longo, oombyoka nda pewa kuTate, oyo tayi hokolola ndje notayi ulike kutya Tate oye a tuma ndje.
And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.	Tate, ngoka a tuma ndje, oye mwene ta hokolola ndje. Ne inamu uva nando olumwe ewi lye, ne inamu mona ondjelo ye.
And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.	Oohapu dhe kadhi mo mune ongoshinima tashi kalelele, oshoka ne inamu itaala ngoka a tumwa kuye.
Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.	Ne otamu konakona mOmanyolo, oshoka otamu dhiladhila kutya mugo omo tamu mono omwenyo gwaaluhe. Omanyolo ngoka ogo naanaa taga hokolola ndje.
And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.	Ne inamu hala okuya kungame, opo mu kale mu na omwenyo.
I receive not honour from men.	“Ngame itandi kongo esimano lyaantu.
But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.	Ihe ngame ondi mu shi kutya kamu na ohole yokuhola Kalunga moomwenyo dheni.
I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.	Ngame onde ya medhina lyaTate, ne noinamu taamba ndje. Ngele taku zi gulwe i ili te ya molwe mwene, ne otamu mu taamba.
How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?	Otamu vulu ngiini okwiitaala, ne mboka hamu simanekathana, ihe esimano ndyoka tali zi kuKalunga awike, ihamu li kongo.
Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.	Inamu dhiladhila kutya ongame tandi ke mu lya ko kuTate. Moses oye te ke mu lya ko, Moses tuu ngoka mwe mu inekela.
For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.	Oshoka ando omwa li mwi itaala shili Moses, ando nangame wo omwi itaala ndje. Oshoka Moses okwa nyola ta hokolola ndje.
But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?	Ihe sho inaamu itaala shoka a nyola, otamu vulu ngiini okwiitaala oohapu dhandje?”
After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.	Konima yaambika Jesus okwa yi handiyaka yefuta lyaGalilea kokutya lyaTiberias.
And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.	Ongundu onene yaantu oye mu landula, oya mono iikumithalonga mbyoka a longo, sho a aludha aavu.
And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.	Jesus okwa londo kondundu nokwa kuutumba nkoka pamwe naalongwa ye.
And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.	Ihe Opaasa, oshituthi shAajuda, osha li popepi.
When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?	Jesus sho a yelutha omeho ge koombinga noombinga, okwa mono ongundu onene yaantu taye ya kuye, nokwa ti kuFilippus: “Otatu ka landa peni iikulya ya gwana okupalutha aantu mboka ayehe?”
And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.	Shika okwe shi ti, a yeleke Filippus, oshoka ye mwene okwa li e shi shoka a hala okuninga.
Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.	Filippus okwe mu yamukula a ti: “Iikwiila yiimaliwa omathele gaali itayi ya gwanene, opo kehe gumwe a pewe nando okapambu okashona kowala.”
One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,	Gumwe gwomaalongwa ye, Andreas, omumwayina gwaSimon Petrus, okwa ti:
There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?	“Mpaka ope na okamati ke na iikwiila itano yiilya noohi mbali. Ihe mbika otayi kwatha shike aantu oyendji ye thike mpoka?”
And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.	Jesus okwe ya lombwele a ti: “Kuutumbikeni aantu.” Opwa li pu na omwiidhi ogwindji pehala ndyoka. Aantu ayehe oya kuutumba ihe. Ko okwa li ku na aalumentu ye thike pomayuvi gatano.
And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.	Jesus okwa kutha ihe iikwiila, a hambelele nokwe yi topolele aantu mboka ya kuutumba. Osho wo a ningi kombinga yoohi. Ayehe oya mono iikulya ya gwana.
When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.	Aantu ayehe sho ya kuta, Jesus okwa lombwele aalongwa ye a ti: “Gongeleni iipambu ayihe mbyoka ya hupu ko, opo pwaa hepe nando osha.”
Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.	Yo oye yi gongele ihe, noyu udha oontungwa omulongo nambali niipambu yiikwiila itano yiilya mbyoka ya hupu kumboka ya lya.
Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.	Aantu mboka ya mono oshikumithalonga shika Jesus a ningi, oya ti: “Nguka oye naanaa omuhunganeki ngoka a li e na okuya muuyuni.”
When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.	Jesus okwa li e shi shi kutya aantu oya hala okuya, ye mu kwate noye mu ninge omukwaniilwa koonkondo; onkee okwa shuna kondundu oye awike.
And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,	Ongulohi sho ye ya, aalongwa ye oya yi komunkulo gwefuta.
And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.	Oya yi mowato noya kambadhala okutaaguluka efuta, ya ye kuKapernaum. Okwa li kwa luudha nale nokuli, ihe Jesus okwa li inee ya natango kuyo.
And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.	Pethimbo tuu ndyoka ombepo onene oya tameke okupepa noya tukulutha efuta.
So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.	Sho ya dhugu oshikako shi thike pookilometa ntano nenge hamano, oya mono Jesus te ende kombanda yomeya u uka kowato, oyo noya haluka.
But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.	Ihe Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Inamu tila, ongame!”
Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.	Oya li ya hala oku mu taamba mowato, ihe ohaluka yowala owato oya thiki kevi kehala nkoka taa yi.
The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;	Esiku lya landula aantu mboka natango ya li handiyaka yefuta, oya mono kutya owato yimwe ayike ya thigwa hwiyaka. Oya li wo ye shi shi kutya Jesus ina ya mowato pamwe naalongwa ye, ihe aalongwa oya yi oyo ayeke.
(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)	Ihe oowato oonkwawo dha zi kuTiberias, odhe ya komunkulo popepi nehala ndyoka aantu ya li ya lile po iikwiila, Omuwa sho a li a hambelele.
When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.	Aantu sho ya mono Jesus kee ko nkoka nosho wo aalongwa ye, oya yi moowato noya taagulukile kuKapernaum, ye ke mu konge.
And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?	Aantu oya adha Jesus handiyaka yefuta noya ti kuye: “Muhongi, owe ya po uunake mpano?”
Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.	Jesus okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Ne itamu kongo ndje molwaasho mwa mono iikumithalonga mbyoka nda longo, ihe omolwaashoka mwa li iikwiila mbiyaka nomwa kuta.
Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.	Inamu konga iikulya mbyoka tayi hulu po, ihe kongeni iikulya mbyoka tayi kalelele sigo omomwenyo gwaaluhe. Iikulya mbyoka oyo mbyoka Omuna gwOmuntu te ke yi mu pa, oshoka oye tuu ngoka He Kalunga e mu tula oshihako she.”
Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?	Oyo oya ti kuye: “Otu na okuninga shike, opo tu longe iilonga yaKalunga?”
Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.	Jesus okwe ya yamukula nokwa ti kuyo: “Iilonga mbyoka Kalunga a hala, mu longe, oyo mbika: Itaaleni ngoka a tumwa kuye.”
They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?	Oyo oya ti kuye: “Oshikumithalonga oshini po to shi longo, tu shi mone, tse tu ku itaale? Oto ningi shike?
Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.	Ootatekulu oya lile omanna mombuga, ngashika naanaa kwa nyolwa: ‘Oye okwe ya pe oshikwiila shomegulu, ya lye!’ ”
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.	Jesus okwe ya lombwele a ti: “Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Moses haye e mu pele oshikwiila shomegulu, ihe Tate oye te mu pe oshikwiila shashili tashi zi megulu.
For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.	Oshoka oshikwiila shoka Kalunga te shi gandja, osho Omwana, ngoka a kuluka megulu nota pe uuyuni omwenyo.”
Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.	Oyo oya ti kuye: “Omuwa, tu pa aluhe oshikwiila shoka.”
And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.	Jesus okwe ya lombwele a ti: “Ongame oshikwiila shomwenyo. Ngoka te ya kungame, ita ka sa we ondjala, naangoka ti itaale ndje, ita ka sa we enota.
But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.	Ngashingeyi otandi mu lombwele kutya nonando omwa mono ndje, natango tuu inamu itaala.
All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.	Aantu ayehe mboka Tate a pa ndje, otaa ya kungame. Ngame noitandi tidha po nando ogumwe ngoka te ya kungame,
For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.	oshoka ngame onda za megulu; inandi ya okugwanitha ehalo lyandje mwene, ihe olyaanguka a tuma ndje.
And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.	Ehalo lyaanguka a tuma ndje, olyo ndika kutya ndaa kanithe po nando ogumwe gwaayehe mboka Tate e ya pa ndje, ihe ndi ke ya yumudhe ayehe mesiku lyahugunina.
And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.	Oshoka ehalo lyaTate olyo ndika: Kehe ngoka ta mono Omwana note mu itaale, oku na omwenyo gwaaluhe; ngame otandi ke mu yumudha mesiku lyahugunina.”
The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.	Aajuda oya tameke okungungutula, Jesus sho a ti: “Ongame oshikwiila shoka sha kuluka megulu.”
And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?	Oyo noya ti: “Nguno ke shi nani Jesus, omuna gwaJosef? He nayina otu ya shi. Ongiini ano ngashingeyi, sho ta ti kutya okwa za megulu?”
Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.	Jesus okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Inamu ngungutula.
No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.	Kaku na nando omuntu ta vulu okuya kungame, okuninga Tate, nguka a tuma ndje, te mu eta kungame; nangame otandi ke mu yumudha mesiku lyahugunina.
It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.	Aahunganeki oya nyola ya ti: ‘Aantu ayehe otaa ka kala ya longwa kuKalunga.’ Kehe ngoka tu uvu shoka Tate ta popi notashi mu longo, ote ya kungame.
Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.	Shika itashi ti kutya oku na ando omuntu a mono Tate, aawe, ihe Omwana ngoka a zi kuKalunga, oye awike a mono Tate.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.	Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: ngoka i itaala, oku na omwenyo gwaaluhe.
I am that bread of life.	Ongame oshikwiila shomwenyo.
Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.	Oohokulu oya lile omanna mombuga, ihe oya sa.
This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.	Ihe oshikwiila shika sha kuluka megulu oshi li ngeyi kutya kehe ngoka te shi li, ita si.
I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.	Ongame oshikwiila shomwenyo shoka sha kuluka megulu. Kehe ngoka ta li oshikwiila shika, ota kala e na omwenyo sigo aluhe. Oshikwiila shoka tandi mu pe, osho onyama yandje, ndjoka tandi yi gandja, yi ninge omwenyo guuyuni.”
The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?	Shika oshe eta oontamanana oonene mokati kAajuda. Oyo oya pulathana ya ti: “Omulumentu nguno ota vulu ngiini oku tu pa onyama ye, tu yi lye?”
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.	Jesus okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Ngele itamu li onyama yOmuna gwOmuntu ne itamu nu ombinzi ye, itamu kala mu na omwenyo meni lyeni.
Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.	Ngoka ta li onyama yandje nota nu ombinzi yandje, oye oku na omwenyo gwaaluhe, nangame otandi ke mu yumudha mesiku lyahugunina.
For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.	Oshoka onyama yandje oyo okulya kwashili nombinzi yandje oyo okunwa kwashili.
He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.	Ngoka ta li onyama yandje nota nu ombinzi yandje, ota kala mungame, nangame otandi kala muye.
As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.	Ngashika naanaa Tate, ngoka a tuma ndje, e na omwenyo, osho nangame wo ndi na omwenyo omolwe. Onkee kehe ngoka ta li onyama yandje, ota ka kala e na omwenyo omolwandje.
This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.	Oshikwiila osho shika sha kuluka megulu. Sho inashi fa oshikwiila shoka sha lilwe koohokulu e taa si. Ngoka ta li oshikwiila shika, ota kala e na omwenyo sigo aluhe.”
These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.	Oohapu ndhika Jesus okwe dhi popi mosinagoga muKapernaum, sho a li ta longo aantu.
Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?	Oyendji yomaalongwa ye mboka yu uvu oohapu ndhika, oya ti: “Elongo ndika ekukutu unene, olye ta vulu oku li pulakena?”
When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?	Jesus sho e shi dhimbulula mwene kutya aalongwa ye otaa ngungutula molwoohapu ndhoka a popi, okwa ti kuyo: “Omwe etha eitaalo omolwoohapu ndhika?
What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?	Ongiini ano, ngele tamu ka mona Omuna gwOmuntu ta londo ta shuna nkoka a li shito?
It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.	Ombepo oyo tayi tula omwenyo, onyama kayi na shoka tayi kwatha. Oohapu ndhoka nde mu lombwele odho Ombepo nomwenyo.
But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.	Ihe natango tuu mokati keni omu na yamwe mboka inayi itaala.” Oshoka okuza petamekolela Jesus okwa kala e shi shi kutya oolye mboka inaaye mu itaala naangoka te ke mu gwaaleka kutya olye.
And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.	Oye kwa gwedha ko a ti: “Osho tuu shoka nde mu lombwele kutya kaku na nando omuntu ta vulu okuya kungame, okuninga Tate te shi mu pitikile.”
From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.	Okuza kesiku ndyoka oyendji yomaalongwa ye oya shuna monima yo inaa enda we pamwe naye.
Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?	Jesus okwa lombwele ihe aalongwa ye mboka omulongo nayaali a ti: “Ne inamu hala okuya?”
Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.	Simon Petrus okwe mu yamukula: “Omuwa, otatu yi kulye? Ngoye ou na oohapu ndhoka tadhi gandja omwenyo gwaaluhe.
And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.	Ngashingeyi tse otwi itaala notu shi shi kutya ngoye Omuyapuki ngoka wa za kuKalunga.”
Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?	Jesus okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Inandi mu hogolola mu li omulongo nayaali? Ihe nando ongaaka, gumwe oye omuhindadhi.”
He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.	Oshinima shika okwe shi popi omolwaJudas yaSimon Iskariot. Oshoka Judas nando okwa li gumwe gwaamboka omulongo nayaali, oye a li te ke mu gwaaleka.
After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.	Konima yaambika Jesus okwe ende muGalilea. Oye okwa li inaa hala okweenda muJudea, oshoka Aajuda yaankoka oya li ya hala oku mu dhipaga.
Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.	Oshituthi shAajuda, oshituthi shomatsali giihwali, osha li popepi.
His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.	Aamwayina yaJesus aalumentu oye mu lombwele ihe ya ti: “Za po mpaka, u ye kuJudea, aalongwa yoye opo ya mone iilonga mbyoka yi longo.
For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.	Oshoka kape na ando omuntu ta longo sha meholamo, ngele okwa hala a tseyike. Onkee ano i ihololela uuyuni.”
For neither did his brethren believe in him.	Oshoka naamwayina aalumentu wo oya li inaaye mu itaala.
Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.	Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Ethimbo ndyoka lyo opalela ndje inali thika natango. Ihe ne omu na aluhe ethimbo ndyoka lye mu opalela.
The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.	Ne uuyuni itau mu tondo, ihe ngame ou tonde ndje, oshoka otandi u hololele kutya iilonga yawo iiwinayi.
Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.	Ne indeni mpeyaka koshituthi. Ngame itandi yi ko koshituthi shika, oshoka ethimbo lyandje inali thika natango.”
When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.	Oye okwe ya lombwele oohapu ndhika nokwa kala natango muGalilea.
But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.	Hugunina aamwayina aalumentu sho ya yi koshituthi, Jesus naye wo okwa yi ko. Ye ina ya ko puuyelele, ihe okwa yi ko meholamo.
Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?	Aajuda oya kala taye mu kongo moshituthi noya pulathana ya ti: “Oye oku li peni?”
And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.	Mongundu yaantu omwa kala enongono olindji omolwe. Aantu yamwe oya ti: “Oye omulumentu omwaanawa.” Ihe yamwe oya ti: “Aawe, ota pukitha aantu.”
Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.	Ihe kakwa li nando omuntu ngoka e mu popi puuyelele, oshoka oya li ya tila Aajuda.
Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.	Metifa lyoshituthi Jesus okwa yi motempeli nokwa tameke okulonga aantu.
And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?	Aajuda oya kumwa noonkondo noya ti: “Omulumentu nguka okwa tseya ngiini Omanyolo, nando ina longwa?”
Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.	Jesus okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Elongo ndika tandi li longo, kali shi lyandje mwene, ihe olya za kuKalunga, ngoka a tuma ndje.
If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.	Kehe ngoka a hala okuvulika kehalo lyaKalunga, ota ka dhimbulula elongo ndika tandi longo, ngele olya zi kuKalunga, nenge ote popi ashike mungame mwene.
He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.	Omuntu ngoka ta popi muye mwene, ota kambadhala okwiikongela esimano. Ihe ngoka ta kongo esimano lyaanguka e mu tuma, oye omunashili ye ke na nando iifundja yasha meni lye.
Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?	Moses ine mu pa ompango? Ihe kape na nando ogumwe gwomune ta vulika kompango. Omolwashike mwa hala okudhipaga ndje?”
The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?	Aantu oye mu yamukula ya ti: “Shila ou niwe kompwidhuli. Olye a hala oku ku dhipaga?”
Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.	Jesus okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Oshilonga shimwe ashike nda longo, ne amuhe nomwa kumwa.
Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.	Molwaashoka Moses okwe mu pe oshipango, mu fukaleke aana yeni aamati, (nonando haMoses e shi gandja, ihe ooho oyo ye shi tameke), ne ohamu ya fukaleke nomEsabati.
If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?	“Ngele okufukaleka omuntu mEsabati itaku yono ompango yaMoses, omolwashike mwa geele ndje, sho nda aludha omuntu mEsabati?
Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.	Inamu pangula ngaashi tamu tala nomeho, ihe panguleni epangulo lyu uka.”
Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?	Nena aantu yamwe yomuJerusalem oya ti: “Nguka haye nani ngoka aakuluntu yetu Aajuda ya hala oku mu dhipaga?
But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?	Tala, ota popi montaneho yawo, ihe kape na nando ngoka ta ti sha kuye. Nenge aakuluntu oya dhimbulula kutya omulumentu nguka oye Kristus?
Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.	Tse otwa tseya omulumentu nguka nkoka a za, ihe Kristus ngele te ya, kape na ngoka e shi nkoka ta zi.”
Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.	Jesus okwa popi mokule motempeli ta longo aantu e ta ti: “Omu shi ndje tuu nomu shi ko tuu nkoka nda za? Ngame inandi ya molwandje mwene. Ngoka a tumu ndje, oye omunashili. Ne nokamu mu shi.
But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.	Ngame ondi mu shi, oshoka onda zi kuye, noye a tuma ndje.”
Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.	Oyo oya li ya hala oku mu kwata, ihe molwaashoka ethimbo lye olya li inaali thika natango, kape na nando ogumwe e mu tula iikaha.
And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?	Ihe aantu oyendji yomongundu oye mu itaale noya ti: “Kristus nge te ya, ota ka longa tuu iikumithalonga iinene yi vule mbika tayi longwa komulumentu nguno?”
The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.	Aafarisayi oyu uvu enongono lyongundu ndjoka yaantu taa popi iinima mbika kombinga yaJesus. Nena yo pamwe naayambi aakuluntu oya tumu aalangeli, ya ka kwate Jesus.
Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.	Jesus okwe ya lombwele: “Ngame ondi li pune okathimbo okafupi natango, opo ihe otandi yi kungoka a tuma ndje.
Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.	Ne otamu ka kala nokukonga ndje, ihe itamu ka mona ndje, oshoka nkoka tandi ka kala, kamu vulu okuya ko.”
Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?	Aajuda oya pulathana ya ti: “Omulumentu nguka ota yi peni ando, mpo itaatu mu mono we? Otayi kiilando yAagreka nkoka kwa kala Aajuda, a ka longe Aagreka?
What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?	Oye okwa hala okutya ngiini, sho a ti: Ne otamu kala nokukonga ndje ne itamu ka mona ndje; naankoka tandi yi, itamu vulu okuya ko.”
In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.	Esiku lyahugunina lyoshituthi olya li lya simana unene. Esiku olyo tuu ndyoka Jesus okwa thikama nokwiigidha a ti: “Kehe ngoka a sa enota, ne ye kungame, a nwe.
He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.	Ngaashi kwa nyolwa taku ti: ‘Kehe ngoka i itaala ndje, meni lye otamu ka tondoka omilonga dhomeya omanamwenyo.’ ”
(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)	Jesus okwa popi ta dhiladhila Ombepo ngoka ta ka pewa mboka ye mu itaala. Pethimbo ndyoka Ombepo okwa li inaa gandjwa natango, oshoka Jesus okwa li inaa adhimithwa natango.
Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.	Yamwe yomongundu sho yu uvu oohapu ndhika, oya ti: “Kapu na omalimbililo, omulumentu nguka oye omuhunganeki.”
Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?	Ooyakwawo oya ti: “Oye Kristus.” Ihe yamwe ishewe oya ti: “Kristus ita zi ndishi muGalilea?
Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?	Enyolo otali ti kutya Kristus ota zi moluvalo lwaDavid nota valelwa muBetlehem, moshilando moka David a li a kala.”
So there was a division among the people because of him.	Osho ngeyi omaludhi oga tameke mokati kaantu omolwe.
And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.	Yamwe oya li ya hala okukwata Jesus, ihe kapwa li nando ogumwe e mu gumu.
Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?	Aalangeli oya shuna kaayambi aakuluntu nokaafarisayi, mboka ye ya pula: “Omolwashike inaamu mu eta huka?”
The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.	Aalangeli oye ya yamukula: “Noshitonale inaku monika omuntu ta popi ngashika omulumentu ngwiyaka.”
Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?	Aafarisayi oye ya pula ya ti: “Nane wo omwa hongololwa?
Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?	Ope na tuu nando ogumwe gwomaakuluntu yetu nenge gwomaafarisayi e mu itaala?
But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.	Aantu mbaka inaa tseya ompango yaMoses, onkee oye li kohi yethingo lyaKalunga.”
Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)	Nikodemus, ngoka a yile nale kuJesus uusiku, okwa li gumwe gwawo. Okwa ti:
Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?	“Pampango yetu tse itatu vulu okupangula nando omuntu, manga inaa pulakenwa tango, opo ku monike shoka a ningi.”
They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.	Yo oye mu yamukula ya ti: “Nangoye wo owa za kuGalilea nani? Konakona Omanyolo, nena oto ka dhimbulula kutya muGalilea inamu za nando onale omuhunganeki.”
And every man went unto his own house.	Nokonima kehe gumwe okwa yi kaandjawo.
Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.	Ihe Jesus okwa yi kOndundu yooholivi.
And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.	Ongula onene yesiku lya landula okwa yi ishewe motempeli. Aantu ayehe oye ya kuye, okwa kuutumba nokwa tameke oku ya longa.
And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,	Aalongimpango naafarisayi oye eta mo omukiintu a kwatwa moluhondelo noye mu kaleke omuthika montaneho yawo ayehe.
They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.	Oyo oya ti kuJesus: “Muhongi, omukiintu nguka okwa adhelelwa moluhondelo lwo lwene.
Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?	Mompango yetu Moses okwe tu pa oshipango kutya aantu ya tya ngaaka oye na okudhipagwa nomamanya. Ngoye oto ti ngiini?”
This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.	Shika oye shi popi taye mu makele, opo ya vule oku mu tamaneka. Jesus okwa petama nokwa nyola pevi nomunwe gwe.
So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.	Sho ya dhiginine oku mu pula, Jesus okwa petuka ihe e ta ti kuyo: “Ngoka gwomokati keni kee na oondjo, ne mu umbe tango nemanya.”
And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.	Ye okwa petama ishewe nokwa nyola pevi.
And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.	Oyo sho ye dhi uvu, oya yi gumwe nagumwe okutameka kaakuluntu. Jesus okwa thigala po oye awike nomukiintu ngoka a thikama koshipala she.
When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?	Jesus okwa petuka nokwa ti kuye: “Nekulu, mbeyaka yalwe oye li peni? Inapu thigala nando ogumwe, e ku pangule?”
She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.	Ye okwa ti: “Aawe, nando ogumwe, Omuwa.” Jesus okwe mu lombwele: “Nangame wo itandi ku pangula. Inda ano, ngoye ino yona we.”
Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.	Jesus okwe ya lombwele ishewe a ti “Ongame uuyelele wuuyuni. Kehe ngoka ta landula ndje, ite ende we momilema, ihe ota kala e na uuyelele mokukalamwenyo kwe.”
The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.	Aafarisayi oye mu lombwele ya ti: “Ngashingeyi oto ihokolola mwene. Ehokololo lyoye kali na oshilonga.”
Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.	Jesus okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Nonando otandi ihokolola mwene, shoka tandi popi, oshoshili. Oshoka ngame ondi shi ko nkoka nda za naankoka tandi yi. Ne kamu shi ko nkoka nda za naankoka tandi yi.
Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.	Ne otamu pangula pantu, ihe ngame ite pangula nando omuntu.
And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.	Nongele tandi pangula, epangulo lyandje olyu uka, oshoka ngame kandi li awike moshinima shika, ihe otu li naTate, ngoka a tuma ndje.
It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.	Nomompango yeni omwa nyolwa kutya ehokololo lyaantu yaali ngele olya tsa kumwe, nena shoka taya ti, oshoshili.
I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.	Ngame otandi ihokolola ngame mwene, naTate, ngoka a tuma ndje, ota hokolola ndje wo.”
Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.	Oyo oye mu pula: “Ho oku li peni?” Jesus okwe ya yamukula: “Ngame kamu shi ndje, naTate kamu mu shi. Ando omwa li mu shi ndje, ando naTate omu mu shi wo.”
These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.	Oohapu ndhika adhihe Jesus okwe dhi popi, sho a li ta longo aantu motempeli mondjugo ndjoka mwa li mu na iiketha yomayambo. Ihe kape na nando omuntu e mu kwata, oshoka ethimbo lye olya li inaali thika manga.
Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.	Jesus okwe ya lombwele ishewe a ti. “Ngame otandi yi; ne otamu ka kala nokukonga ndje, ihe otamu ka sila moondjo dheni. Kokuma nkoka tandi yi, itamu vulu okuya ko.”
Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.	Aajuda oya ti: “Okwa hala ando okwiidhipaga, sho ta ti: ‘Kokuma nkoka tandi yi, itamu vulu okuya ko?’ ”
And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.	Jesus okwa yamukula a ti: “Ne omwa za huka kevi, ihe ngame onda za kombanda. Ne oyomuuyuni mbuka, ihe ngame kandi shi gwomuuyuni mbuka.
I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.	Onkee ano onde mu lombwele kutya otamu ka sila moondjo dheni. Oshoka ngele itamu itaale kutya ‘Ngame ongame tuu ngoka,’ otamu ka sila moondjo dheni.”
Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.	Oyo oye mu pula: “Ongoye lye ano?” Jesus okwa yamukula: “Osho tuu shoka nde mu lombwele okuza petameko.
I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.	Ngame ondi na iinima oyindji oku mu popya noku mu pangula. Ihe ngoka a tumu ndje, omunashili, naashoka tandi uvu kuye, osho tandi lombwele uuyuni.”
They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.	Yo oya li kaa uvite ko kutya ye ote ya lombwele He.
Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.	Onkee Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Uuna tamu ka yelutha Omuna gwOmuntu pombanda, otamu ka dhimbulula kutya ‘Ngame ongame tuu ngoka’. Osho wo otamu ka dhimbulula kutya ngame itandi vulu okuninga sha ngame mwene, ihe otandi popi ashike shoka Tate a longa ndje.
And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.	Oongoka a tuma ndje, oku li pamwe nangame. Ye ine etha ndje, ndi kale awike, oshoka ngame otandi longo aluhe shoka she mu opalela.”
As he spake these words, many believed on him.	Aantu oyendji mboka yu uvu, Jesus sho ta popi iinima mbika, oye mu itaale.
Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;	Jesus okwa lombwele ihe Aajuda mboka ye mu itaala a ti: “Ngele tamu vulika koohapu dhandje, nena kapu na omalimbililo, one aalongwa yandje.
And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.	Ne otamu ka tseya ihe oshili, noshili otayi ke mu mangulula.”
They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?	Oyo oye mu yamukula: “Otse aana yaAbraham, katu na nando oompoka twa li aapika yomuntu. Oto dhiladhila shike, sho to ti: ‘Ne otamu ka mangululwa?’ ”
Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.	Jesus okwe ya yamukula: “Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Kehe ngoka ta longo uulunde, oye omupika guulunde.
And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.	Omupika iha kala aluhe megumbo, ihe omuvalwa oha kala mo aluhe.
If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.	Omwana ngele te mu mangulula, nena kape na omalimbililo, otamu kala mwa manguluka.
I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.	Ondi shi shi kutya ne aana yaAbraham. Ihe onkene tuu omwa hala okudhipaga ndje ne inamu hala okutaamba elongo lyandje.
I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.	Ngame otandi popi shoka nde shi mono puTate, osho wo ne otamu longo shoka mwa lombwelwa kuho.”
They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.	Oyo oye mu yamukula noya ti: “Tate oAbraham.” Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Ando okwa li Abraham oye ho, ando otamu longo iilonga mbyoka Abraham a longo.
But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.	Ashihe shoka ngame nda ningi, osho oku mu hokololela oshili ndjoka nda uvu kuKalunga, ihe ne omwa hala okudhipaga ndje. Abraham ina ninga nando osha sha tya ngaaka.
Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.	Ne otamu longo iilonga yaho.” Oyo oya ti kuye: “Tse inatu valwa moluhondelo, otu na tate gumwe awike, oKalunga.”
Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.	Jesus okwe ya lombwele a ti: “Ando okwa li Kalunga oye ho, ando omu hole ndje. Oshoka ngame onda za muKalunga nondi li mpaka ngashingeyi. Ngame inandi ya mungame mwene, ihe oye a tuma ndje.
Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.	Omolwashike kaamu uvite ko shoka tandi ti? Omolwashoka ne itamu vulu okupulakena oohapu dhandje.
Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.	Ne omu na ho omuhindadhi, nomwa hala okulandula uuhalu waho. Oye omudhipagi okuza ketameko ye ke na nando oompoka a li moshili, oshoka muye kamu na nando oshili. Ngele ta popi iifundja, ota popi shoka shomuukwatya we mwene, oshoka oye omufundja nahe yiifundja ayihe.
And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.	Ngame onde mu lombwele oshili, onkee inamu itaala ndje.
Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?	Olye gwomune ta vulu okuulika kutya ondi na oondjo. Ngele otandi popi oshili, omolwashike ano inaamu itaala ndje?
He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.	Ngoka a za muKalunga, ota pulakene oohapu dhaKalunga. Ne inamu za muKalunga, onkee inamu hala okupulakena oohapu dhe.”
Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?	Aajuda oya yamukula Jesus ya ti: “Ongoye Omusamaria nou niwe kompwidhuli?”
Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.	Jesus okwa yamukula: “Ngame kandi na ompwidhuli. Ngame otandi simaneke Tate, ihe ne omwa dhina ndje.
And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.	Ngame itandi kongo esimano lyandje mwene. Ope na gumwe ngoka te li kongele ndje noye ta pangula.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.	Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Kehe ngoka ta vulika koohapu dhandje, ke na mpoka ta ka sa sigo aluhe.”
Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.	Aajuda oya ti kuye: “Ngashingeyi otu shi shi nawa kutya ou niwe kompwidhuli. Tate Abraham okwa sa, naahunganeki oya sa, ihe ngoye oto ti: ‘Kehe ngoka ta dhiginine oohapu dhandje, ke na mpoka ta ka sa sigo aluhe.’
Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?	Ngoye omunene nani u vule tate Abraham ngoka a sa? Aahunganeki nayo wo oya sa nale. Ngoye oto iningi lye?”
Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:	Jesus okwa ti. “Ngame ando onda li tandi kongo esimano lyandje mwene, ando esimano lyandje kali na oshilonga. Tate, ngoka hamu ti, oye Kalunga keni, oye ota simaneke ndje.
Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.	Ne nokamu mu shi, ihe ngame ondi mu shi. Ando ondi tye kandi mu shi, nena ando ongame omufundja ngashika ne. Ihe ngame ondi mu shi nohandi dhiginine oohapu dhe.
Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.	Ho Abraham okwa nyanyukwa pombanda okumona esiku lyandje; okwe li mono nokwa nyanyukwa.”
Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?	Aajuda oya ti kuye: “Ngoye ino gwanitha natango oomvula omilongo ntano, ihe oto ti, owa mono Abraham?”
Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.	Jesus okwe ya yamukula: “Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Abraham manga inaa valwa, ngame oko nda li nale.”
Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.	Aajuda oya toola omamanya, ye mu dhenge, ihe Jesus okwa holama nokwa zi mo motempeli.
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.	Jesus manga a li te ende, okwa mono omulumentu omuposi, nkene tuu a valwa.
And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?	Aalongwa ye oye mu pula ya ti: “Muhongi, olye a yono, omulumentu nguka opo a valwe omuposi? Aakuluntu ye nenge oye mwene?”
Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.	Jesus okwa yamukula. “Uuposi we kau na sha noondjo dhe nenge dhaakuluntu ye. Ye okwa ningi omuposi, opo oonkondo dhaKalunga dhi hololwe muye.
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.	Tse otu na okukala tatu longo iilonga yaanguka a tumu ndje, manga tu na omutenya. Uusiku otau ya, uuna kaape na we ngoka ta vulu okulonga.
As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.	Manga ngame ndi li muuyuni, ongame uuyelele wuuyuni.”
When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,	Jesus sho a popi oohapu ndhika, okwa hiyile omayeye pevi nokwe ga pilulile mumwe nevi e ta gwayeke enono ndyoka komeho gomulumentu ngoka
And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.	nokwa ti kuye: “Inda, u ki iyoge moshipala medhiya lyaSiloa.” (Edhina ndika otali ti “Omutumwa.”) Omulumentu okwa yi e ti iyogo moshipala nokwa galuka ko omunameho.
The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?	Nena aashiinda naantu mboka ya li haye mu mono shito, sho ta hehela, oya ti: “Omulumentu nguka haye ngoka a li ha kuutumba ta hehela?”
Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.	Yamwe oya ti: “Oye ngoka.” Ihe ooyakwawo oya ti: “Aawe, haye, okwe mu fa ashike.” Omulumentu ye mwene okwa ti: “Ongame ngaa.”
Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?	Oyo oye mu pula ya ti: “Omeho goye oga tonatithwa ngiini?”
He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.	Oyo okwa yamukula a ti: “Omulumentu ngwiyaka haku tiwa Jesus, oye a pilula enono lyomayeye nokwe li gwayeke komeho gandje e ta lombwele ndje, ndi ki iyoge moshipala medhiya lyaSiloa. Ngame onda yi, naasho ndi iyogo, onda tonata.”
Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.	Oyo oya ti kuye: “Omulumentu ngoka oku li peni?” Oye okwa ti: “Kandi shi wo.”
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.	Nena oya fala omulumentu ngoka a li nale omuposi, kaafarisayi.
And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.	Esiku ndyoka Jesus a li a pilula enono lyomayeye nokwa tonatitha omeho ge, olya li Esabati.
Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.	Aafarisayi oya pula ishewe omulumentu, nkene a ningi omunameho. Oye okwe ya lombwele a ti: “Omwaaludhi gwandje okwa tula ndje enono pomeho, ngame ondi iyogo moshipala nonda mono ko.”
Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.	Yamwe yomaafarisayi oya ti: “Omulumentu ngoka a ningi oshinima shika, ina za kuKalunga, oshoka iha vulika kompango yEsabati.” Ooyakwawo oya ti: “Omulumentu nguka ngele omulunde, ota vulu ngiini okulonga iikumithalonga yi thike mpaka?” Opo nopwa holoka etopoko mokati kawo.
They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.	Aafarisayi oya pula natango omulumentu ngoka a li omuposi: “Ngoye oto tile ngiini omulumentu ngoka a tonatitha omeho goye?” Oye okwa yamukula a ti: “Oye omuhunganeki.”
But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.	Aajuda oya li inaa hala okwiitaala kutya omulumentu nguka okwa li omuposi, ihe ngashingeyi oku wete ko, sigo yi ithana aakuluntu yaangoka a tonatithwa
And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?	noye ya pula ya ti: “Nguno omuna gweni? Mwa ti, okwa valwa omuposi? Ongiini ano, sho e wete ko ngashingeyi?”
His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:	Aakuluntu ye oya yamukula ya ti: “Tse otu shi shi kutya ye omumwetu nokwa valwa omuposi.
But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.	Ihe katu shi wo kutya oshe ende ngiini, ngashingeyi sho e wete ko. Osho wo ngoka a tonatitha omeho ge, katu mu shi. Puleni omwaaludhwa. Ye okwa koka, na yamukule ye mwene.”
These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.	Aakuluntu ye oya popi ngeyi, oyo oya li ya tila Aajuda. Oshoka Aajuda oyu uvanene kutya kehe ngoka ta hempulula kutya Jesus oye Kristus, ota kondwa mo mosinagoga.
Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.	Onkee aakuluntu ye oya ti “Oye okwa koka, mu puleni.”
Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.	Aafarisayi oya ithana olutiyali omulumentu ngoka a li omuposi noya ti kuye. “Uvaneka koshipala shaKalunga kutya oto ka popya oshili! Tse otu shi shi kutya omulumentu ngwiyaka omulunde.”
He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.	Omwaaludhwa okwa yamukula a ti: “Ngame kandi shi wo, ngele ye omulunde. Shimwe ashike ndi shi shi, osho shika: Ngame onda li omuposi, ihe ngashingeyi ondi wete ko.”
Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?	Oyo oya ti kuye: “Okwe ku ningi ngiini ano? Omeho goye okwe ga tonatitha ngiini?”
He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?	Oye okwe ya yamukula: “Onde mu hokololole nale, ihe inamu pulakena. Omolwashike mwa hala oku shi uva natango? Nane wo omwa hala okuninga aalongwa ye?”
Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.	Aafarisayi oye mu nyana ya ti: “Ongoye awike omulongwa gwe, tse aalongwa yaMoses.
We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.	Tse otu shi shi kutya Kalunga okwa popile naMoses, ihe omulumentu ngoka katu shi nkoka a za.”
The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.	Omutonatithwa okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Oshikumitha osho shika kutya ne kamu shi nkoka a za, ihe oye tuu a tonatitha omeho gandje.
Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.	Tseni atuheni otu shi shi kutya Kalunga iha pulakene ewi lyaalunde, ihe oha pulakene aantu mboka haye mu tila nohaa gwanitha ehalo lye.
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.	Okuza ketameko lyuuyuni inaku uvika nando ogumwe a tonatitha omeho gomuntu a valwa omuposi.
If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.	Omulumentu nguka ando okwa li inaa za kuKalunga, ando ke na shoka ta vulu okuninga.”
They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.	Oyo oye mu yamukula ya ti: “Ngoye owa valelwa nowa putukila muulunde, ihe owa hala oku tu longa?” Oyo noye mu umbu mo mosinagoga.
Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?	Jesus oku uvu kutya oye mu umbu mo mosinagoga. Sho e mu mono, okwa ti kuye: “Ngoye owi itaala Omuna gwOmuntu?”
He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?	Omulumentu okwa yamukula a ti: “Tatekulu, lombwela ndje kutya oye olye, opo ndi vule oku mu itaala.”
And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.	Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Owe mu mona nale noye ngoka ta popi nangoye ngashingeyi.”
And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.	Oye okwa ti: “Omuwa, ondi itaala.” Oye okwa tsu oongolo koshipala shaJesus.
And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.	Jesus okwe mu lombwele a ti. “Ngame onde ya muuyuni mbuka okupangula, opo mboka ihaa mono ko, ya mone ko, naamboka haa mono ko, ya tsike.”
And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?	Yamwe yomaafarisayi mboka ya li pamwe naye, oyu uvu oohapu ndhika noya ti kuye: “Oto dhiladhila kutya natse wo aaposi?”
Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.	Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Ando omwa li aaposi, ando kamu na oondjo, ihe sho tamu ti: ‘Tse otu wete ko,’ nena otashi ti, omu na oondjo.”
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.	“Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Kehe ngoka ta yi moshigunda shoonzi itaa pitile posheelo, ihe ota gwayele mo palwe, oye omufuthi nomuyugi.
But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.	Ihe ngoka ta yi mo ta pitile posheelo, oye omusita gwoonzi.
To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.	Omulangeli gwoposheelo ote mu egulula, noonzi otadhi uvu ewi lye, sho te dhi ithana komadhina e te dhi piitha mo.
And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.	Ngele a piitha mo oonzi dhe adhihe, ote dhi kwatele komeho, dho e tadhi mu landula, oshoka odhi shi ewi lye.
And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.	Ihe omukwiilongo itadhi mu landula, otadhi mu yi ontuku, oshoka ewi lye kadhi li shi.”
This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.	Eyele ndika Jesus okwe li ya lombwele, ihe yo oya li kaa uvite ko kutya okwa hala okutya shike.
Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.	Jesus okwe ya lombwele ishewe a ti: “Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Ongame osheelo shoonzi.
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.	Ayehe mboka ya tetekele ndje, oyo aafuthi naayugi, noonzi inadhi ya pulakena.
I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.	Ongame osheelo. Kehe ngoka ta yi mo ta pitile mungame, ota ka hupithwa. Ye ota kala nokuya mo nokupita mo e ta mono ko oshinapelo.
The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.	Omufuthi ohe endele owala okuyaka, okudhipaga nokuhanagula. Ngame onde ya, opo ya kale ye na omwenyo meudhililo alihe lya gwana.
I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.	“Ongame omusita ngo omwaanawa. Omusita omwaanawa ota gandjele oonzi omwenyo gwe.
But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.	Nakufutwa ngoka kee shi omusita noonzi kadhi shi dhe mwene, ota thigi po oonzi e ta fadhuka po, ngele ta mono embungu tali ya. Osho ngeyi embungu otali dhi umpile e tali dhi halakanitha po.
The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.	Nakufutwa a tya ngaaka ota yi ontuku, oshoka ye ota longele owala ondjambi, ye ke na ko nasha noonzi.
I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.	Ngame omusita ngo omwaanawa.
As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.	Ngaashi Tate e shi ndje, nangame ondi shi Tate, osho wo ngame oonzi dhandje ondi dhi shi nadho odhi shi ndje. Ngame ondi na ehalo okusa molwadho.
And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.	Oku na oonzi dhandje dhilwe ndhoka kaadhi mo moshigunda shika. Nadho wo ondi na oku dhi eta mo, notadhi ka uva ewi lyandje e tadhi ka ninga oshigunda shimwe nodhi na omusita gumwe.
Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.	“Tate oku hole ndje, oshoka ngame ondi na ehalo okugandja omwenyo gwandje, opo ndi ke gu taambulule ishewe.
No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.	Kaku na nando ogumwe ta kutha ndje omwenyo gwandje. Ongame mwene tandi gu gandja kehalo lyandje mwene. Ngame ondi na oonkondo oku gu gandja nondi na wo oonkondo oku gu taambulula. Shika osho shoka Tate a lombwele ndje, ndi ninge.”
There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.	Omaludhi oga tameke ishewe mokati kAajuda omolwoohapu ndhika.
And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?	Oyendji yomuyo oya ti: “Ye oku niwe kompwidhuli nota yi oonkwengu. Otamu mu pulakenene shike?”
Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?	Ooyakwawo oya ti: “Omunampwidhuli ita vulu okupopya oohapu dha tya ngeyi! Ompwidhuli otayi vulu tuu okutonatitha omeho gaaposi?”
And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.	Ethimbo lyokudhana oshituthi sheyapulo lyotempeli muJerusalem olya thiki, nokwa li okufu.
And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.	Jesus okwa li te ende motempeli mOndunda yaSalomo.
Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.	Nena Aajuda oye mu gongalele noya ti: “Sigo uunake to tu kaleke nomalimbililo? Tu lombwela oshili yoyene, ngele ongoye Kristus.”
Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.	Jesus okwe ya yamukula: “Onde mu lombwela nale, ihe ne inamu hala okwiitaala ndje. Iilonga mbyoka tandi longo medhina lyaTate, oyo tayi hokolola ndje.
But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.	Ihe ne inamu hala okwiitaala, oshoka kamu shi oonzi dhandje.
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:	Oonzi dhandje ohadhi uvu ewi lyandje; ngame ondi dhi shi, dho notadhi landula ndje.
And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.	Ngame otandi dhi pe omwenyo gwaaluhe; dho kadhi na mpoka tadhi ka yonuka po sigo aluhe nokape na ngoka te dhi yugu mo moshikaha shandje.
My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.	Tate, ngoka e dhi pa ndje, oye omunene e vule ayehe, onkee kape na ngoka ta vulu oku dhi yuga mo moshikaha she.
I and my Father are one.	Tse naTate gumwe.”
Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.	Aajuda oya toola ishewe omamanya, ye mu dhipage.
Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?	Jesus okwe ya yamukula: “Ngame onda longo iilonga oyindji iiwanawa mbyoka Tate a pa ndje, ndi yi longe mokati keni. Omolwoshilonga shini po shomumbino mwa hala okudhipaga ndje nomamanya?”
The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.	Aajuda oye mu yamukula: “Tse inatu hala oku ku dhipaga omolwoshilonga shontumba oshiwanawa ando, ihe omolwashoka to sheke Kalunga. Ngoye omuntu gwowala, ihe owa hala okwiininga Kalunga.”
Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?	Jesus okwe ya yamukula: “Mompango yeni omwa nyolwa kutya Kalunga ota ti: ‘One ookalunga.’
If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;	Tse otu shi shi kutya shoka tashi tiwa kenyolo ndika, oshoshili sigo aluhe: Aantu mboka Kalunga a pa oohapu dhe, okwe ya ithana ookalunga.
Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?	Otamu vulu ngiini ano okutya, otandi sheke Kalunga, sho tandi ti kutya ngame Omuna gwaKalunga, ngame ngoka Tate a hogolola nokwa tuma ndje muuyuni?
If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.	Ngame ngele itandi longo iilonga yaTate, inamu itaala ndje.
But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.	Ihe ngele otandi yi longo, peha lyokwiitaala ndje itaaleni iilonga yo yene, opo mu tseye ne mu uve ko lela kutya Tate oku li mungame nangame ondi li muTate.”
Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,	Oyo oya li ya hala ishewe oku mu kwata, ihe ye okwa zi mo miikaha yawo nokwa yi.
And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.	Jesus okwa shuna natango handiyaka yomulonga gwaJordan, kehala ndyoka Johannes a li ha shasha aantu, nokwa kala nkoka.
And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.	Aantu oyendji oye ya kuye. Oyo noya ti: “Johannes ina longa nando oshikumithalonga, ihe iinima ayihe mbyoka Johannes a popya kombinga yomulumentu nguka, oyoshili.”
And many believed on him there.	Aantu oyendji yaankoka oye mu itaale.
Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.	Omulumentu gumwe gwomuBetania, edhina lye Lasarus, okwa li ta alukwa. MuBetania omo maandjawo yaMaria nomumwayina Marta.
(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)	Maria nguka oye ngoka a gwayekele oompadhi dhOmuwa nokwe dhi thetithile omafufu gokomutse gwe. Omumwayina nguka Lasarus okwa li ta alukwa.
Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.	Nena aamwayina mboka aakiintu oya tumine Jesus elaka ya ti: “Omuwa, kuume koye omuholike ota alukwa.”
When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.	Jesus sho e shi uvu, okwa ti: “Uuvu mboka itau ka fala Lasarus meso, ihe owokusimanekitha Kalunga, nOmuna gwaKalunga opo wo a simanekithwe kuwo.”
Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.	Jesus okwa li e hole Marta, Maria naLasarus.
When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.	Ye sho u uvu kutya Lasarus ota alukwa, okwa kala natango omasiku gaali pehala mpoka a adhika.
Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.	Konima yomasiku ngoka gaali Jesus okwa lombwele aalongwa ye a ti: “Tu shuneni natango kuJudea.”
His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?	Aalongwa oya ti kuye: “Muhongi, opwa piti okathimbo okashona kowala, sho Aajuda ya li taa kambadhala ya hala oku ku dhipaga. Ihe owa hala ishewe okushuna ko?”
Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.	Jesus okwa yamukula a ti: “Omutenya kagu na ootundi omulongo nambali? Ngoka te ende omutenya, ita punduka, oshoka oku wete uuyelele womuuyuni mbuka.
But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.	Ihe ngoka te ende uusiku, ota punduka, oshoka muye kamu na uuyelele.”
These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.	Jesus sho a popi oohapu ndhika, okwa ti kuyo: “Kuume ketu Lasarus okwa kotha, ihe ngame onda hala, ndi ye, ndi ke mu penduthe.”
Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.	Aalongwa oye mu yamukula: “Omuwa, ngele okwa kotha, ota ka aluka.”
Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.	Jesus okwa li ta popi okusa kwaLasarus, ihe yo oya li ye shi, ota popi okukotha kwoomposi.
Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.	Onkee Jesus okwe ya lombwele sha yela ta ti: “Lasarus okwa sa.
And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.	Ngame onda nyanyukwa molweni, sho inaandi adhika ko, opo mu itaale. Tu yeni ano kuye.”
Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.	Nena Tomas, ngoka ithanwa Mukwanambwiyu, okwa lombwele aalongwa ooyakwawo a ti: “Natu yeni atuheni nomuhongi, opo tu ka sileni pamwe naye.”
Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.	Jesus sho a thiki ko, okwa adha Lasarus a ninga nale omasiku gane mombila.
Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:	Okalando hoka Betania oka li popepi naJerusalem, ookilometa ndatu lwaampoka.
And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.	Oyendji yomAajuda oya adhika ye ya kuMarta naMaria oku ya hupulutha molweso lyomumwayina Lasarus.
Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.	Ano Marta sho u uvu kutya Jesus okwe ya, okwa yi e ke mu tsakaneke, ihe Maria okwa kala a kuutumba megumbo.
Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.	Marta okwa ti kuJesus: “Omuwa, ando owa li po, ando omumwameme ina sa.
But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.	Ihe ondi shi shi kutya natango Kalunga ote ke ku pa ashihe shoka to mu indile.”
Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.	Jesus okwe mu lombwele: “Omumwanyoko ota ka yumuka.”
Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.	Marta okwa ti kuye: “Ondi shi shi kutya ota ka yumuka mesiku lyahugunina.”
Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:	Jesus okwe mu lombwele: “Ongame eyumuko nomwenyo. Oongoka i itaala ndje, ota kala e na omwenyo, nando ona se.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?	Osho wo kehe ngoka e na omwenyo ye i itaala ndje, ita si we sigo aluhe. Owe shi itaala?”
She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.	Ye okwa yamukula: “Eeno, Omuwa, ondi itaala kutya ongoye Kristus, Omuna gwaKalunga, ngoka e na okuya muuyuni.”
And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.	Marta sho a popi oohapu ndhika, okwa yi nokwi ithana omumwayina Maria, yi ikalela, e te mu lombwele: “Muhongi oku li mpaka e ku pumbwa.”
As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.	Maria sho e shi uvu, okwa thikama mbala e ta yi kuye.
Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.	Ihe Jesus okwa adhika inaa thika natango mokalando, okwa li natango kehala ndyoka Marta e mu tsakanekele.
The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.	Nena Aajuda mboka ya adhika ye li naMaria megumbo taye mu hupulutha, sho ye mu mono a thikama ta piti mo nokweendelela, oye mu landula. Oya li ye shi, ota yi kombila, a ka lile.
Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.	Maria sho a thiki kehala ndyoka kwa li Jesus, okwe mu mono nokwa tsu oongolo poompadhi dhe e ta ti kuye: “Omuwa, ando owa li po, ando omumwameme ina sa.”
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.	Ano Jesus sho e mu mono ta lili, nosho wo Aajuda mboka ye ya pamwe naye, okwa hendwa komutima noku uvite uudhigu meni lye.
And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.	Oye okwa pula: “Omwe mu fumvike peni?” Oyo oye mu yamukula: “Omuwa, ila u tale.”
Jesus wept.	Opo Jesus okwa lili.
Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!	Nena Aajuda oya ti: “Tala, nkene kwa li e mu hole.”
And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?	Ihe yamwe yomuyo oya ti: “Oye Okwa tonatitha omeho gomuposi. Okwa li ando a nyengwa okukeelela, Lasarus kaa se?”
Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.	Jesus okwa adhika ishewe kuudhigu momwenyo gwe e ta yi kombila, ndjoka ya li ekololo lya siikilwa nemanya.
Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.	Jesus okwe ya lombwele a ti: “Kuthii po emanya!” Marta, omumwayina gwomusi okwa ti kuye: “Omuwa, okwa nika nokuli, oshoka okwa ningi ngashingeyi omasiku gane a sa.”
Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?	Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Inandi ku lombwela kutya ngele owi itaala, oto ka mona eadhimo lyaKalunga?”
Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.	Oyo oya kutha po emanya. Nena Jesus okwa tala pombanda e ta ti: “Tate, otandi ku hambelele, ongoye sho ho uvu ndje.
And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.	Ondi shi shi kutya ngoye oho uvu ndje aluhe, ihe otandi popi oohapu ndhika omolwaantu mbaka ya kundukidha ndje, opo yi itaale kutya ongoye wa tuma ndje.”
And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.	Sho a popi oohapu ndhika, okwi igidha newi enene a ti: “Lasarus, za mo!”
And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.	Nena Lasarus, ngoka a li a sa, okwa zi mo. Oompadhi dhe nomaako ge oya li ya mangwa nomalapi, noshipala she osha mangwa nonasituke. Jesus okwe ya lombwele: “Mu mangululeni, ne mu mu ethe, a ye.”
Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.	Oyendji yomAajuda mboka yi ile okuhupulutha Maria, oya mono shoka Jesus a ningi noye mu itaale.
But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.	Ihe yamwe yomuyo oya yi kaafarisayi noye ya hokololele shoka Jesus a ningi.
Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.	Nena aafarisayi naayambi aakuluntu oya hiya oshigongi shaatokoli e taa ti: “Otu na okuninga ngiini? Oshoka omulumentu nguka ota longo unene iikumithalonga oyindji.
If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.	Ngele otatu mu etha ngaaka, a tsikile nomukalo ngoka, aantu ayehe otaye ke mu itaala. Nena Aaroma otaa ke ya e taa hanagula po otempeli noshigwana shetu ashihe.”
And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,	Gumwe gwomuyo, edhina lye Kajafas, ngoka a li omuyambimukuluntu omumvo ngwiyaka, okwa ti: “Ne kamu na shoka mu shi.
Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.	Inamu tseya nani kutya okusa kwomuntu gumwe peha lyaantu ayehe okuhwepo ku vule okuyonukapo kwoshigwana ashihe?”
And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;	Sho shene, ina popya oshinima shika muye mwene, aawe, ihe molwaashoka a li omuyambimukuluntu omumvo ngwiyaka, okwa hunganeke ngaaka kutya Jesus ota ka sila oshigwana shAajuda,
And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.	nohamolwoshigwana shAajuda ashike, ihe opo wo a kongolole aana yaKalunga ayehe mboka ye li po ya halakana, ya ninge ongundu yimwe.
Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.	Okuza kesiku ndyoka aakuluntu yAajuda oyu uvanene, ya dhipage Jesus.
Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.	Onkee ano Jesus ine enda we puuyelele mokati kAajuda, ihe okwa yi komukunda gu li popepi nombuga, koshilando shi ithanwa Efraim, e ta kala nkoka pamwe naalongwa ye.
And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.	Ano Opaasa, oshituthi shAajuda, oya li popepi. Aantu oyendji yokomikunda dhokokule oye ya kuJerusalem manga Opaasa inaayi thika, opo yi iyoge.
Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?	Oyo oya kongo Jesus. Sho ya gongalele motempeli, oya pulathana ya ti: “Otamu dhiladhila ngiini? Oye ote ya tuu koshituthi?”
Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.	Ihe aayambi aakuluntu naafarisayi oya adhika ya gandja nale elaka kutya ngele oku na ngoka e shi Jesus mpoka e li, ne shi holole, opo ye mu kwate.
Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.	Sho kwa li ku na omasiku gahamano, Opaasa yi thike, Jesus okwe ya kuBetania, nkoka kwa kala Lasarus, omulumentu ngoka Jesus a yumudha kuusi.
There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.	Oyo oye mu pakele po omwiha. Marta okwa yakula, ihe Lasarus okwa li gumwe gwaantu mboka ya kuutumba koshililo pamwe naJesus.
Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.	Nena Maria okwa kutha omugwayo gwonardilela gu na ondilo nokwe gu tile koompadhi dhaJesus e te dhi thetitha omafufu gokomutse gwe. Ezimba ewanawa lyomugwayo nolyu udhitha egumbo alihe.
Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,	Ihe Judas Iskariot, gumwe gwomaalongwa ye, oongoka a li te ke mu gwaaleka, okwa ti:
Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?	“Omolwashike omugwayo nguka inaagu landithwa po? Ando ogwa zi iimaliwa omathele gatatu e tayi pewa oohepele.”
This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.	Shika ine shi popya molwaasho ando a li e na oshimpwiyu noohepele, ihe omolwashoka okwa li omufuthi. Onkee sho kwa li ha humbata okampunda kiimaliwa, okwa li hi ikwatha ye mwene niimaliwa mbyoka.
Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.	Ihe Jesus okwa ti: “Mu etha, a pungulile shoka e na esiku lyefumviko lyandje.
For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.	Oohepele omu dhi na aluhe, ihe ngame itandi kala aluhe pune.”
Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.	Ongundu onene yAajuda oyu uvu kutya Jesus oku li muBetania noya yi ko. Inaa ya ko molwaJesus awike, ihe oya li wo ya hala okumona Lasarus, ngoka Jesus e mu yumudha kuusi.
But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;	Aayambi aakuluntu oyu uvanene okudhipaga wo Lasarus.
Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.	Oshoka omolwehokololo lye Aajuda oyendji oya gamuka ko kaawiliki yawo noyi itaale Jesus.
On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,	Esiku lya landula ongundu onene yaamboka ye ya koshituthi shOpaasa, oyu uvu kutya Jesus ote ya kuJerusalem.
Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.	Nena oya kutha iitayi yomilunga e taa yi, ye ke mu tsakaneke. Oyo oyi igidha ya ti: “Hosianna; Kalunga ne mu laleke nuuyamba ngoka te ya medhina lyOmuwa. Kalunga na laleke nuuyamba omukwaniilwa gwaIsrael.”
And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,	Jesus okwa mono ihe okasino nokwe ka kayile, ngashika naanaa enyolo tali ti:
Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.	“Shilando shaSion, ino tila! Tala, omukwaniilwa gwoye te ya kungoye, a kayila ontana yokasino.”
These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.	Aalongwa ye oya li kaa uvite ko oshinima shika tango, ihe Jesus sho a yeluthilwa pombanda mesimano, oya dhimbulula kutya enyolo otali popi oshinima shika, naantu oye mu ningile iinima mbika ayihe.
The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.	Aantu mboka ya li pamwe naJesus, sho i ithana Lasarus, a ze mo mombila nokwe mu yumudha, oya hokolola shoka sha ningwa po.
For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.	Onkee ano ongundu yaantu oye mu tsakaneke, oshoka oyu uvu kutya okwa longo oshikumithalonga shika.
The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.	Aafarisayi oya lombwelathana: “Mu wete ko! Kamu na shoka tamu vulu we. Tala, uuyuni auhe otau mu landula.”
And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:	Aagreka yamwe yomumboka haa yi kuJerusalem okugalikana pethimbo lyoshituthi,
The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.	oye ya kuFilippus ngoka a za kuBetsaida shomuGalilea, noye mu indile ya ti: “Tatekulu, tse otwa hala okumona Jesus.”
Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.	Filippus okwa yi e te shi lombwele Andreas. Andreas naFilippus oya yi e taye shi lombwele Jesus.
And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.	Jesus okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Ethimbo olye ya, Omuna gwOmuntu a pewe esimano enene.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.	Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Omuma yoshilya ngele itayi gwile mevi e tayi sile mo, otayi kala yimwe ayike, ihe ngele tayi sile mo otayi vala oomuma odhindji.
He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.	Oongoka e hole omwenyo gwe, ote gu kanitha, ihe ngoka ta tondo omwenyo gwe muuyuni mbuka, ote gu hupithile momwenyo gwaaluhe.
If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.	Ngele ku na ngoka a hala okuyakula ndje, na landule ndje, naankoka ngame ndi li, oko nkoka omuntu gwandje ta ka kala. Oongoka ta yakula ndje, Tate ote ke mu simaneka.”
Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.	“Ngashingeyi omwenyo gwandje ogwa tukuluka. Ondi tye shike we? Tate, hupitha ndje mokathimbo nkaka. Ihe osho tuu shika she eta ndje mokathimbo nkaka komahepeko.
Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.	Tate, simanekitha edhina lyoye.” Nena megulu omwa zi ewi lya ti: “Onde li simanekitha notandi li simanekitha natango.”
The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.	Ongundu yaantu mboka ya li ya thikama mpoka, oyu uvu ewi noya ti: “Omvula ya ndunduma.” Ooyakwawo oya ti: “Omuyengeli a popi naye.”
Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.	Jesus okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Ewi ndika inali popya molwandje, ihe omolweni.
Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.	Uuyuni mbuka otau pangulwa ngashingeyi. Omupangeli guuyuni mbuka ota ka umbilwa pondje ngashingeyi.
And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.	Ihe uuna ngame tandi ka yeluthwa mo mevi, aantu ayehe otandi ke ya hilila kungame.”
This he said, signifying what death he should die.	Shika okwe shi popi, opo a holole kutya eso ndyoka e na okusa, olya tya ngiini.
The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?	Aantu oye mu yamukula: “Ompango yetu oye tu lombwela kutya Kristus ota kala e na omwenyo aluhe. Ngoye oto ti ngiini ano kutya Omuna gwOmuntu oku na okuyeluthwa? Omuna gwOmuntu ngoka olye?”
Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.	Jesus okwe ya lombwele a ti: “Oku na okathimbo okafupi natango uuyelele u li mokati keni. Kaleni tamu ende, manga mu na uuyelele, opo mwaa adhike komilema. Oshoka ngoka te ende momilema, ke shi ko nkoka ta yi.
While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.	Ano manga mu na uuyelele, itaaleni uuyelele, opo mu ninge aantu yuuyelele.”Jesus sho a popi oohapu ndhoka, okwa zi po e te ya holama.
But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:	Nonando ye okwa longo iikumithalonga mbyoka ayihe montaneho yawo, inaye mu itaala.
That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?	Opo shoka sha popiwa komuhunganeki Jesaja, shi tse, sho ta ti: “Omuwa, olye i itaale euvitho ndyoka twe li uvitha? Olye ngoka Omuwa e mu hololele oonkondo dhe?”
Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,	Onkee oya nyengwa okwiitaala, oshoka Jesaja okwa tile ishewe:
He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.	“Kalunga okwa tsikitha omeho gawo, okwa kukutike omitima dhawo, opo omeho gawo kaaga mone ko, oondunge dhawo dhaa uve ko, opo yaa itedhulule, ngaye ndaaye ya aludhe.”
These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.	Jesaja okwa popi oohapu ndhika, oshoka okwa mono eadhimo lyaJesus nokwe mu hokolola.
Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:	Onkene tuu oyendji yomaawiliki yAajuda oya itaale Jesus; ihe omolwaafarisayi inaye shi hempulula montaneho yaantu, opo kaaya kondwe mo mosinagoga.
For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.	Oshoka yo oya li ye hole okupandika kaantu komeho gokupandika kuKalunga.
Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.	Nena Jesus okwi igidha a ti: “Oongoka i itaala ndje, hangame awike i itaala, ihe okwi itaala wo naangoka a tuma ndje.
And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.	Oongoka a mono ndje, okwa mono naangoka a tuma ndje.
I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.	Ngame onde ya, ndi kale uuyelele wuuyuni, opo kehe ngoka ti itaale ndje, kaa kale we momilema.
And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.	Kehe ngoka tu uvu oohapu dhandje ye ite dhi dhiginine, hangame tandi ke mu pangula. Oshoka ngame inandi ya okupangula uuyuni, ihe oku u hupitha.
He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.	Oongoka itaa taamba ndje ye itaa taamba oohapu dhandje, oku na omupanguli gwe ngoka te mu pangula. Oohapu ndhoka nda popya, odho tadhi ka kala omupanguli gwe esiku lyahugunina.
For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.	Oshoka ngame inandi popya mungame mwene, ihe Tate, ngoka a tuma ndje, oye a pe ndje oshipango shoka ndi na oku shi tya noku shi popya.
And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.	Ngame ondi shi shi kutya oshipango she otashi gandja omwenyo gwaaluhe. Onkee ano shoka nda ti, osho shoka Tate a lombwele ndje, ndi tye.”
Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.	Olya li esiku lya tetekela lyOpaasa. Jesus okwa li e shi kutya ethimbo lye olya thikana okuthiga po uuyuni mbuka, a ye kuHe. Oye ngaashi a kala e hole mboka ye ya li muuyuni, okwa li e ya hole sigo opehulilo.
And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;	Jesus naalongwa ye manga ya li puulalelo, omuhindadhi okwa adhika a tula nale etokolo muJudas yaSimon Iskariot a gwaaleke Jesus.
Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;	Jesus okwa li e shi shi kutya He okwe mu pa iinima ayihe miikaha ye. Oye okwa li wo e shi shi kutya ye okwa za kuKalunga nota yi kuKalunga.
He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.	Onkee okwa thikama poshililo, e ti ihula onguwo ye yokombanda nokwa kutha oshihanduke e te shi imanga mombunda.
After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.	Oye okwa tile ihe omeya moshiyaha shokwiiyogela e ta tameke okuyoga oompadhi dhaalongwa nokwe dhi pyaanitha oshihanduke shoka e shi imanga mombunda.
Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?	Okwe ya kuSimon Petrus. Nena Petrus okwa ti kuye: “Omuwa, ongoye to yogo oompadhi dhandje?”
Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.	Jesus okwe mu yamukula a ti: “Shoka tandi ningi, ku shi shi manga ngashingeyi, ihe oto ke shi tseya komeho.”
Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.	Petrus okwe mu lombwele: “Ku na mpoka noka yoga oompadhi dhandje sigo aluhe!” Jesus okwe mu yamukula: “Ngele itandi yogo oompadhi dhoye, nena ku shi we omulongwa gwandje.”
Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.	Simon Petrus okwa yamukula: “Omuwa, ino yoga ashike oompadhi dhandje, ihe yoga wo iikaha yandje nomutse.”
Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.	Jesus okwa ti: “Ngoka a yogwa okwa yela shekesheke ye ina pumbwa okwiiyoga ye mwene, kakele koompadhi dhe. Ne amuhe omwa yela, kakele kagumwe.”
For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.	Jesus okwa li a tseya nale ngoka te ke mu gwaaleka, onkee a ti: “Ne amuhe omwa yela, kakele kagumwe.”
So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?	Ano Jesus sho a mana okuyoga oompadhi dhawo, okwa zala onguwo ye yokombanda nokwa shuna ishewe pehala lye. Okwa ti kuyo: “Omu uvite ko tuu shoka nde mu ningile?
Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.	Ohamu ithana ndje Muhongi nOmuwa, noshu uka, sho hamu ningi ngaaka, oshoka ongame tuu ngoka.
If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.	Ngame Omuwa nomuhongi gweni sho nda yogo ngashingeyi oompadhi dheni, nane wo omu na okuyogathana koompadhi.
For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.	Oshoka ngame onde mu pe oshiholelwa, opo mu ninge naanaa ngashika nde mu ningile.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.	Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Omuyakuli ke shi omunene e vule mwene gwe, nomutumwa ke shi omunene e vule omutumi gwe.
If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.	Ngashingeyi omu shi uvithe ko. One aanelago, ngele tamu shi ningi.
I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.	“Ngame itandi mu popi, ne amuhe, ihe ondi ya shi mboka nda hogolola. Ihe enyolo oli na okugwanithwa ndyoka tali ti: ‘Omulumentu ngoka ta li iikulya yandje, okwa pilukila ndje.’
Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.	Shika otandi shi mu lombwele ngashingeyi, manga inaashi ningwa, opo mu itaale kutya Ongame ngoka, uuna tashi ka ningwa.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.	Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Ngoka ta taamba kehe gumwe ngoka tandi mu tumu, oye ota taamba ndje, naangoka ta taamba ndje, ota taamba ngoka a tuma ndje.”
When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.	Jesus sho a popi oohapu ndhoka, okwa tukuluka mombepo ye e ta ti: “Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Gumwe gwomokati keni ota ka gwaaleka ndje.”
Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.	Aalongwa oya talathana ya limbililwa.
Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.	Gumwe gwomaalongwa ngoka Jesus a li e mu hole, okwa kuutumba ponto ye.
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.	Simon Petrus okwe mu pepe nomeho nokwe mu pula kutya olye ngoka ta popi.
He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?	Omulongwa ngoka okwa hedha popepilela naJesus e te mu pula: “Omuwa, olye ngo?”
Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.	Jesus okwa yamukula: “Oye tuu ngoka tandi mu pe oshipambu shika tandi shi elele mo.” Oye okwe elele ihe oshipambu e te shi pe Judas yaSimon Iskariot.
And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.	Mbalambala Judas sho a li oshipambu shoka, Satana okwa yi mo muye. Nena Jesus okwe mu lombwele: “Shono to ningi, shi ninga nziya.”
Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.	Mwaamboka ya li koshililo kamwa li nando ogumwe ngoka u uvu ko shoka Jesus e mu lombwele.
For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.	Judas sho a li ha kala nokampunda kiimaliwa, yamwe yomaalongwa oya dhiladhila kutya ngiika Jesus okwe mu lombwele, a ye a ka lande shoka ya pumbwa omolwoshituthi, nenge pamwe okwe mu lombwele, a gandje sha koohepele.
He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.	Judas okwa taamba oshipambu shoshikwiila e ta yi mbala pondje; nokwa li uusiku.
Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.	Judas sho a yi pondje, Jesus okwa ti: “Ngashingeyi eadhimo lyOmuna gwOmuntu olya hololwa; ngashingeyi eadhimo lyaKalunga olya hololwa muye.
If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.	Ngele eadhimo lyaKalunga olya hololwa muye, nena Kalunga mwene ota ka holola eadhimo lyOmuna gwOmuntu note ke li holola mbala.
Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.	Aamwandje, itandi ka kala we nane ethimbo ele. Otamu ka konga ndje; ihe otandi mu lombwele ngashingeyi shoka nda lombwele Aajuda kutya kokuma nkoka tandi yi, itamu vulu okuya ko.
A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.	Oshipango oshipe otandi shi mu pe, mu holathane. Ngashi naanaa nangame nda kala ndi mu hole, osho nane wo omu na okuholathana.
By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.	Ngele omu holathane, nena aantu ayehe otaa ka dhimbulula kutya one aalongwa yandje.”
Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.	Simon Petrus okwe mu pula: “Omuwa, oto yi peni?” Jesus okwe mu yamukula: “Ito vulu okulandula ndje ngashingeyi nkoka tandi yi, ihe komeho oto ka landula ndje.”
Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.	Petrus okwa ti kuye: “Omuwa, omolwashike itaandi vulu oku ku landula ngashingeyi: Ngame ondi ilongekidha okusa molwoye.”
Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.	Jesus okwa yamukula: “Owi ilongekidha tuu shili okusa molwandje? Ngame otandi ku lombwele oshili: Ekondombolo manga inaali iga, ngoye o idhimbike ndje lutatu.”
Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.	Jesus okwa lombwele aalongwa ye a ti: “Oomwenyo dheni inadhi kala dha ziyalala. Itaaleni Kalunga ne mu itaale ndje wo.
In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.	Megumbo lyaTate omu na omahala gokukala ogendji. Ando kasha li ngeyi, ando otandi mu lombwele kutya otandi ke mu longekidhila ehala.
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.	Nongele nda yi e tandi mu longekidhile ehala, otandi ka galuka ishewe, ndi mu ile, opo mu ka kale wo nkoka ndi li.
And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.	Ondjila yaankoka tandi yi, omu yi shi.”
Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?	Tomas okwa ti kuye: “Omuwa, tse katu shi ko nkoka to yi. Ondjila otatu vulu ngiini oku yi tseya?”
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.	Jesus okwe mu lombwele: “Ongame ondjila noshili nomwenyo. Kape na ngoka ta vulu okuya kuTate, okuninga ta pitile mungame.
If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.	Ngele omu shi ndje, otamu ka tseya wo naTate. Okuza ngashingeyi omu mu shi nomwe mu mona.”
Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.	Filippus okwa ti kuye: “Omuwa, tu ulukila Ho, shika osho shoka twe shi pumbwa.”
Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?	Jesus okwe mu lombwele: “Ngame onda kala nane amuhe ethimbo ele, ihe nani ku shi ndje, Filippus? Kehe ngoka a mono ndje, okwa mona wo Tate. Omolwashike ano to ti: ‘Tu ulikila Ho?’
Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.	Ino itaala nani, Filippus, kutya ngame ondi li muTate naTate oku li mungame?” Jesus okwa ti ihe kaalongwa ye: “Oohapu ndhoka tandi mu lombwele, itandi dhi popi mungame mwene; ihe Tate, ngoka e li mungame, oye ta longo iilonga ye.
Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.	Itaaleni ndje kutya ngame ondi li muTate naTate oku li mungame. Ihe ngele inamu hala okwiitaala, itaaleni molwiilonga.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.	Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Kehe ngoka i itaala ndje, ota ka longa wo iilonga mbyoka tandi longo. Eeno, oye ota ka longa nokuli iilonga iinene yi vule mbika, oshoka ngame otandi yi kuTate.
And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.	Nena shaa shoka tamu shi indile medhina lyandje, otandi shi ningi, Tate opo a simanekithwe mOmwana.
If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.	Ngele otamu indile ndje sha medhina lyandje, otandi shi ningi.”
If ye love me, keep my commandments.	“Ngele omu hole ndje, nena otamu vulika komalombwelo gandje.
And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;	Ngame otandi ki indila Tate, oye note ke mu pa Omupopili gulwe, Ombepo yoshili, a kale pamwe nane aluhe.
Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.	Uuyuni itau vulu oku mu taamba, oshoka owo kau mu wete nokau mu shi. Ihe ne omu mu shi, oshoka ota kala pamwe nane noku li mune.
I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.	“Ngame itandi mu thigi po one amuke, ihe otandi ke ya kune.
Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.	Ngele pwa piti okathimbo okafupi kowala, uuyuni itau mono ndje we, ihe ne otamu mono ndje. Molwaashoka ngame ondi na omwenyo, nane wo otamu ka kala mu na omwenyo.
At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.	Esiku ndyoka nge lya thiki, nena otamu ke shi tseya kutya ngame ondi li muTate nane omu li mungame, ngashi naanaa ngame ndi li mune.
He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.	“Kehe ngoka ta taamba omalombwelo gandje nota vulika kugo, oku hole ndje. Tate wo ota kala e hole ngoka e hole ndje, nangame otandi kala ndi mu hole notandi mu ihololele.”
Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?	Judas haangoka yaIskariot, okwa ti kuye: “Omuwa, omolwashike wa hala oku tu ihololela, ihe hauyuni?”
Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.	Jesus okwe mu yamukula ta ti: “Oongoka e hole ndje, ota vulika koohapu dhandje. Tate ota kala e mu hole, tse naTate notatu ya kuye e tatu kala muye.
He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.	Oongoka kee hole ndje, ita vulika koohapu dhandje. Ihe oohapu ndhika nde dhi mu lombwele, kadhi shi dhandje mwene, odha Tate, ngoka a tuma ndje.
These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.	“Iinima mbika onde yi mu lombwele, manga ndi li pune.
But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.	Ihe Omupopili Ombepo Ondjapuki, ngoka Tate ta ka tuma medhina lyandje, ote ke mu longa iinima ayihe, note ke mu dhimbulutha iinima ayihe mbyoka nde mu lombwela.
Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.	“Ombili otandi yi mu thigile. Ombili yandje mwene otandi yi mu pe. Ngame itandi yi mu pe, ngashi uuyuni hau gandja. Oomwenyo dheni inadhi ziyalala, ne inamu tila.
Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.	Ne omu uvu, sho nde mu lombwele kutya otandi yi, ihe otandi ka galukila kune. Ngele omu hole ndje, nena ando otamu nyanyukwa, sho tandi yi kuTate, oshoka Tate oye omunene e vule ndje.
And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.	Ngame otandi shi mu lombwele ngashingeyi, manga inaashi ningwa, opo mu itaale, ngele tashi ka ningwa.
Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.	Itandi vulu we okupopya nane olule, oshoka omupangeli gwuuyuni mbuka oku li pokuya. Ye ke na nando oonkondo dhasha dhi vule dhandje.
But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.	Ihe uuyuni ou na okutseya kutya ngame ondi hole Tate. Onkee otandi longo ayihe, ngashi a lombwele ndje. “Tikameni, tu zeni po mpaka.”
I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.	“Ongame omuviinu gwashili. Tate oye omuneyana lyomiviinu.
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.	Oye ota keke po oshitayi kehe shomungame shoka itaashi imi iiyimati, ihe kehe oshitayi shoka tashi imi, ote shi opaleke, shi ime iiyimati oyindji.
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.	Ne omwa yelithwa nokuli koohapu ndhoka nde dhi mu lombwele.
Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.	Kaleni muukumwe nangame, nangame otandi kala muukumwe nane. Ne itamu vulu okwiima iiyimati, ngele itamu kala mungame, ngashi naanaa oshitayi itaashi vulu okwiima iiyimati, ngele kashi li momuviinu.
I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.	“Ongame omuviinu, ne iitayi. Oongoka ta kala mungame, ngame wo otandi kala muye. Oye noti imi iiyimati oyindji, oshoka mwaa na ndje kamu vulu okulonga nando osha.
If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.	Kehe ngoka ita kala mungame, ote ekelwahi e ta kukuta ngashi oshitayi. Iitayi ya tya ngaaka otayi gongelwa ondumba e tayi umbilwa momulilo moka tayi pile mo.
If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.	Ngele tamu kala mungame noohapu dhandje e tadhi kala mune, nena indileni shaa shoka mwa hala, ne notamu ke shi mona.
Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.	Osho ngeyi Tate ota simanekithwa, ne ngele tamu imi iiyimati oyindji; nopamukalo nguka ne otamu ningi aalongwa yandje.
As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.	Ngashi naanaa Tate e hole ndje, osho wo nangame ndi mu hole. Kaleni ano mohole yandje.
If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.	Ngele otamu vulika komalombwelo gandje, otamu kala mohole yandje naanaa, ngashi ngame he vulika komalombwelo gaTate nonda kala mohole ye.”
These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.	“Shika onde shi mu lombwele, opo enyanyu lyandje li kale mune, nenyanyu lyeni li kale lya gwanenena.
This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.	Oshipango shandje osho shika: Holathaneni, ngashi naanaa ngame ndi mu hole.
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.	Ohole onenenene omuntu ta vulu okukala e yi na yokuhola ookuume ke, oyo okugandja omwenyo gwe molwawo.
Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.	One ookuume kandje, ngele tamu ningi shoka tandi mu lombwele.
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.	Itandi mu ithana we aayakuli, oshoka omuyakuli ita tseya shoka mwene gwe te shi longo. Onkee ano ngame otandi mu ithana ookuume kandje, oshoka iinima ayihe mbyoka nde yi uva kuTate, onde yi mu lombwela.
Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.	Hane mwa hogolola ndje, ongame nde mu hogolola nonde mu tumu, mu ye ko, ne mu imike iiyimati oyindji, iiyimati mbyoka tayi kalelele. Nena shaa shoka tamu shi indile Tate medhina lyandje, ote shi mu pe.
These things I command you, that ye love one another.	Shoka tandi mu lombwele, osho shika: Holathaneni.”
If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.	“Uuyuni ngele tau mu tondo, dhimbulukweni kutya ongame wa tondo tango.
If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.	Ando mwa li yomuuyuni, nena ando uuyuni ou hole aantu yawo. Ihe ngame onde mu yoolola mo muuyuni; omolwaasho uuyuni u na oku mu tonda.
Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.	Dhimbulukweni shoka nde mu lombwele: ‘Omuyakuli ke shi omunene e vule mwene gwe.’ Ngele aantu oya tidhagana ndje, nena otaa ke mu tidhagana wo. Ngele ya vulika koohapu dhandje, otaa ka vulika wo nokudheni.
But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.	Iinima mbika ayihe oyo otaye ke yi mu ningila molwashoka one aalongwa yandje, oshoka inaa tseya ngoka a tuma ndje.
If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.	Ando nda li inaandi ya noinaandi ya lombwela, ando kaye na oondjo. Ihe ngashingeyi oyo kaye na nando osha shokupopila oondjo dhawo.
He that hateth me hateth my Father also.	Oongoka e tonde ndje, oku tonde wo naTate.
If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.	Ando onda li inaandi longa mokati kawo iilonga mbyoka inaayi longwa nando okomuntu, nena ando yo kaye na oondjo. Ihe ngashingeyi sho ya mono shoka nda longa, oye tu tonde atuhe naTate.
But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.	Shika oshi na okukala ngeyi, opo shoka sha nyolwa mompango yawo shi gwanithwe: ‘Oyo oya tondo ndje owala pwaa na nando etompelo.’
But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:	“Ihe Omupopili, Ombepo yoshili, ngoka ta zi kuTate, ote ke ya. Ngame otandi ke mu tuma ta zi kuTate. Oye nota ka hokolola ndje.
And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.	Nane wo otamu ka hokolola ndje, oshoka omwa kala pamwe nangame okuza ketameko.
These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.	“Iinima mbika onde yi mu lombwele, opo mwaa ethe eitaalo.
They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.	Oyo otaa ke mu konda mo moosinagoga dhawo. Ethimbo otali ke ya, uuna kehe gumwe ngoka te mu dhipaga, ta ka dhiladhila kutya moku ninga ngaaka ota longele Kalunga.
And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.	Iinima mbika otaa ke yi mu ningila, oshoka inaa tseya ndje nosho wo Tate kaye mu shi.
But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.	Ayihe mbika onde yi mu lombwele, opo ethimbo lyawo ngele lya thiki lyoku shi ninga, mu dhimbulukwe elondodho lyandje.”“Shika inandi shi mu lombwela petameko, oshoka onda li pune.
But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?	Ngashingeyi otandi yi kunguka a tuma ndje, ihe kape na nando ogumwe gwomune ta pula ndje kutya otandi yi peni?
But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.	Ano ngashingeyi sho nde shi mu lombwele, omu na oluhodhi olunene.
Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.	Onkee ano ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Okuya kwandje otaku mu kwatha, oshoka ngele itandi yi, nena Omupopili ite ya kune. Ihe ngele tandi yi, nena otandi ke mu tuma kune.
And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:	Ano Omupopili ngele te ya, otu ulukile aantu kutya oyo aalunde yo inaa tseya shoka shi li mondjila nepangulo lyaKalunga kutya otali ti shike.
Of sin, because they believe not on me;	Oye otu ulike uulunde waantu, oshoka inaa itaala ndje.
Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;	Oye ote ya ulukile shoka shi li mondjila, oshoka otandi yi kuTate, ne itamu mono ndje we.
Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.	Oye ote ya ulukile epangulo lyaKalunga, oshoka omupangeli guuyuni mbuka okwa pangulwa nale.”
I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.	“Ondi na natango odhindji oku mu lombwela, ihe ngashingeyi otamu nyengwa oku dhi uva ko.
Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.	Ihe Ombepo yoshili nge te ya, ote ke mu longa oshili ayihe. Oye ita popi muye mwene, ihe ote mu lombwele shoka a uvu note mu hololele iinima mbyoka tayi ke ya.
He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.	Oye ota simanekitha ndje, oshoka ota ka kutha mumbyoka ngame nda li ndi na oku popya, e te yi mu lombwele.
All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.	Iinima ayihe yaTate oyandje, onkee nda ti: Ombepo ota kutha shoka nde mu pe e te shi mu lombwele.”
A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.	“Ngele pwa piti okathimbo okafupi kowala, ne itamu ka mona ndje, ihe ngele pwa piti ishewe okathimbo okafupi, otamu ka mona ndje.”
Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?	Yamwe yomaalongwa ye oya pulathana ya ti: “Otashi ti ngiini ano, sho te tu lombwele ta ti: ‘Ngele pwa piti okathimbo okafupi, ne itamu ka mona ndje, ihe ngele pwa piti ishewe okathimbo okafupi, otamu ka mona ndje?’ Ye ta ti ishewe: ‘Shika otashi ningwa, oshoka otandi yi kuTate.’
They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.	Okwa dhiladhila shike, sho ta popi okathimbo okafupi? Katu uvite ko kutya okwa hala okutya shike.”
Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?	Jesus okwa li e shi shi kutya oya hala oku mu pula, onkee okwa ti kuyo: “Otamu pulathana shike? Ngame onda ti: ‘Ngele pwa piti okathimbo okafupi, ne itamu ka mona ndje, nongele pwa piti ishewe okathimbo okafupi, otamu ka mona ndje.’
Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.	Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Ne otamu ka lila nokuyemata, ihe uuyuni otau ka nyanyukwa. Ne otamu ka kala mwa sa oluhodhi, ihe oluhodhi lweni otalu ka shituka enyanyu.
A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.	Omukiintu ngele oku li pokuvala okanona, oku na oluhodhi, oshoka ethimbo lye lyuuwehame olye ya. Ihe okanona ngele ka valwa, ye ota dhimbwa uuwehame we, oshoka okwa nyanyukwa, sho omuntu a valelwa muuyuni.
And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.	Osho naanaa nane mu li. Ngashingeyi omwa sa oluhodhi, ihe otandi ke mu mona natango, nomitima dheni otadhi ka kala dhu udha enyanyu; enyanyu ndyoka kape na ngoka ta vulu oku li mu kutha.”
And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.	“Esiku ndyoka ngele lya thiki, one itamu ka pula ndje nando osha. Ngame otandi mu lombwele oshili: Tate ote ke mu pa shaa shoka tamu indile medhina lyandje.
Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.	Sigo onena inamu indila nando osha medhina lyandje. Indileni, e tamu pewa, enyanyu lyeni opo li kale lyu udhilila pombanda.”
These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.	“Ngame onde mu lombwele iinima ayihe mbika momayele. Ethimbo otali ke ya, uuna itandi ka popya we omayele, ihe otandi ke mu lombwela oohapu dha fatuka kombinga yaTate.
At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:	Esiku ndyoka ngele lya thiki, ne otamu ka indila Tate medhina lyandje, ngame noitandi mu lombwele kutya otandi indile Tate molweni.
For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.	Oshoka Tate oku mu hole, molwaashoka ne omu hole ndje nomwi itaala kutya onda za kuKalunga.
I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.	Ngame onda za kuTate e tandi ya muuyuni, ihe ngashingeyi otandi thigi po ishewe uuyuni notandi yi kuTate.”
His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.	Nena aalongwa ye oya ti kuye: “Ngashingeyi oto popi oohapu dha fatuka; ito popi we nando omayele.
Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.	Ngashingeyi otu shi shi kutya owa tseya iinima ayihe, ngoye ino pumbwa nando omuntu te ku pula omapulo. Shika oshe tu itaalitha kutya ngoye owa za kuKalunga.”
Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?	Jesus okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Omwi itaala ngashingeyi?
Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.	Ethimbo otali ke ya noli li po nokuli, uuna ne amuhe tamu ka halakanithwa. Kehe gumwe oti iyukile kaandjawo, e tamu thigi ndje po awike. Ihe ngame kandi li awike, oshoka Tate oku li pamwe nangame.
These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.	Shika onde shi mu lombwele, opo mu kale mu na ombili tayi zi muukumwe weni nangame. Uuyuni otau ke mu hepeka. Ihe inamu tila, ngame onda sinda uuyuni!”
These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:	Jesus sho a mana okupopya oohapu ndhika, okwa tala kegulu e ta ti: “Tate, ethimbo olye ya. Adhimitha omumwoye, omumwoye opo e ku adhimithe wo.
As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.	Oshoka ongoye we mu pa oonkondo okupangela aantu ayehe, opo a gandje omwenyo gwaaluhe kwaayehe mboka we ye mu pa.
And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.	Mboka ye ku tseya, Kalunga awike kashili, noya tseya wo Jesus Kristus, ngoka we mu tumu, oyo mboka ye na omwenyo gwaaluhe.
I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.	Ngame onde ku adhimitha kombanda yevi, onda tsakanitha oshilonga shoka wa pe ndje, ndi shi longe.
And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.	Tate, adhimitha ndje montaneho yoye ngashingeyi neadhimo olyo tuu ndyoka nda li ndi na pungoye, uuyuni manga inaau shitwa.”
I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.	“Aantu mboka yomuuyuni we pa ndje, onde ya tseyithile edhina lyoye. Oyo oyoye, ngoye nowe ya pe ndje. Oyo oya vulika koohapu dhoye.
Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.	Ngashingeyi oye shi shi kutya ashihe shoka wa pa ndje, osha za kungoye.
For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.	Oshoka ngame onde ya pe oohapu ndhoka wa pe ndje, noye dhi taamba. Oyo oye shi shi kutya ngame onda za shili kungoye, noyi itaala kutya ongoye wa tuma ndje.
I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.	“Otandi ya galikanene. Itandi galikanene uuyuni, ihe oyo mboka we ya pa ndje, oshoka oyo oyoye.
And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.	Ashihe shoka ndi shi na, oshoye, naashihe shoka u shi na, oshandje, neadhimo lyandje olya hololwa muyo.
And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.	Ngashingeyi ngame otandi ya kungoye. Ngame kandi li we muuyuni, ihe yo oye li muuyuni. “Tate Omuyapuki, ya gamena koonkondo dhedhina lyoye, opo ya ninge omuntu gumwe naanaa, ngashi ngame nangoye tu li gumwe.
While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.	Manga ngame nda li pamwe nayo, onde ya gamene koonkondo dhedhina lyoye ndyoka we li pa ndje. Ngame onde ya gamene noinandi kanitha po nando ogumwe gwomuyo, kakele kaangoka a li e na oku ka kana, enyolo opo li gwanithwe.
And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.	“Ngashingeyi otandi ya kungoye, ihe manga ndi li natango muuyuni, otandi popi iinima mbika, opo ya kale ye na enyanyu lyandje momitima dhawo meudhililo alihe.
I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.	Ngame onde ya pe oohapu dhoye, onkee uuyuni otau ya tondo, oshoka yo kaye shi yomuuyuni, ngashi nangame ndaa shi gwomuuyuni.
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.	Ngame itandi ku indile, u ya kuthe mo muuyuni, ihe otandi ku indile, u ya gamene kuMwiinayi.
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.	Ngashi ngame ndaa shi gwomuuyuni, osho wo nayo kaye shi yomuuyuni.
Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.	Ya iyoololela, ya kale moshili, oohapu dhoye odho oshili.
As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.	Ngame onde ya tuma muuyuni, ngaashi ngoye wa tuma ndje muuyuni.
And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.	Ngame otandi igandja kungoye molwawo, opo nayo wo ya kale lela yoye.”
Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;	“Hayo ayeke mbaka tandi galikanene, ihe naamboka wo taa ki itaala ndje molweuvitho lyawo.
That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.	Otandi ya galikanene, opo ayehe ya ninge omuntu gumwe. Tate, naa kale mutse, ongaashi ngoye u li mungame nangame ndi li mungoye. Naa ninge omuntu gumwe, opo uuyuni u itaale kutya ongoye wa tuma ndje.
And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:	Ngame onde ya pa eadhimo ndyoka we li pa ndje, opo ya ninge gumwe, ngashika ngoye nangame tu li gumwe.
I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.	Ngame ondi li muyo nangoye omungame, opo ya ninge lela gumwe, uuyuni opo u tseye kutya ongoye wa tuma ndje nou ya hole, ngashi u hole ndje.
Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.	“Tate, ongoye we ya pa ndje, onkee onda hala, ndi kale pamwe nayo nkoka ndi li, opo ya tale eadhimo lyandje, eadhimo ndyoka wa pa ndje, oshoka ngoye owa kala u hole ndje, nomanga uuyuni inaau shitwa.
O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.	Tate omuyuuki, uuyuni inau ku tseya, ihe ngame ondi ku shi, naamboka yandje oye shi shi kutya ongoye wa tuma ndje.
And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.	Ngame onde ya tseyithile edhina lyoye notandi ka tsikila oku shi ninga, opo ohole ndjoka u hole ndje nayo yi kale muyo, nangame ndi kale muyo.”
When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.	Jesus sho a mana okugalikana, okwa piti mo pamwe naalongwa ye e taa taaguluka okalonga kaKidron. Kokuma nkoka okwa li ku na eyana lyomiti. Jesus naalongwa ye oya yi mulyo.
And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.	Judas, ngoka e mu gwaaleke, okwa li a tseya ehala ndyoka, oshoka Jesus naalongwa ye oya li haa kala ko olwindji.
Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.	Ano Judas okwa yi keyana ndyoka pamwe nongundu yaakwiita nayamwe yomaalangeli yotempeli ya tumwa kaayambi aakuluntu nokaafarisayi. Oyo oya li ye na iikondjitho noya humbata oonyeka noolamba.
Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?	Jesus sho a li a tseya ashihe shoka tashi ke mu adha, okwa zi mo meyana e ta yi kuyo nokwe ya pula a ti: “Otamu kongo lye?”
They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.	Oyo mu yamukula ya ti: “OJesus Omunasareti.” Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Ongame nguka!” Judas, omugwaaleki gwe, okwa li a thikama mpoka pamwe nayo.
As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.	Ano Jesus sho e ya lombwele: “Ongame ngu,” oya shuna lwanima e taa ihata pevi.
Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.	Jesus okwe ya pula ishewe: “Otamu kongo lye?” Oyo oya ti: “OJesus Omunasareti.”
Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:	Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Ngame onde mu lombwele kutya ongame nguka. Ngele ano ongame tamu kongo, nena etheni, aalumentu mbaka ya ye.”
That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.	Oye okwa popi ngeyi, opo oohapu ndhoka a popile dhi gwanithwe: “Inandi kanitha po nando omuntu gumwe gwaamboka wa pa ndje.”
Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.	Simon Petrus sho a li e na egongamwele, okwe li pweya mo e tu umpile omumati gwomuyambimukuluntu nokwa fegula ko okutsi kwe kwokolulyo. Edhina lyomumati ngoka oMalkus.
Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?	Jesus okwa ti kuPetrus: “Shuna mo egongamwele lyoye molumpangwa. Owa dhiladhila ando, ndi kale inaandi nwa oshitenga shomahepeko shoka nde shi pewa kuTate?”
Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,	Ano ongundu yaakwiita pamwe nomuwiliki gwawo naalangeli yomAajuda oya kwata Jesus, e taye mu manga.
And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.	Oye mu fala tango kuAnnas, oshoka oye hemweno yaKajafas, ngoka a li omuyambimukuluntu omumvo ngwiyaka.
Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.	Kajafas nguka oye ngoka a tsile Aajuda omayele kutya oshihwepo, omuntu gumwe nge ta si peha lyaantu ayehe.
And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.	Simon Petrus nomulongwa mukwawo oya landula Jesus. Omulongwa ngoka mukwawo okwa li e shiwike nawa komuyambimukuluntu, onkee okwa yi pamwe naJesus molugumbo lwomeni lyegumbo lyomuyambimukuluntu.
But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.	Ihe Petrus okwa thikama pondje pomweelo. Omulongwa mukwawo, ngoka a li e shiwike komuyambimukuluntu, okwa piti mo e ta popitha omukadhona gwoposheelo nokwe eta Petrus meni.
Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.	Omukadhona ngoka okwa pula Petrus a ti: “Ngoye ku shi gumwe gwomaalongwa yomulumentu nguka?” Petrus okwa ti kuye: “Aawe, hangame.”
And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.	Okwa li ku na uutalala, onkee aayakuli naalangeli oya adhika ya tema omulilo noya thikama ye gu kondeka taa huhulukwa. Petrus okwa yi kuyo nokwa thikama e ta huhulukwa pamwe nayo.
The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.	Omuyambimukuluntu okwa pula Jesus kombinga yaalongwa ye noyelongo lye.
Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.	Jesus okwe mu yamukula a ti. “Ngame ohandi popi aluhe montaneho yomuntu kehe. Onda longele aluhe moosinagoga nomotempeli, moka hamu gongala Aajuda ayehe. Ngame inandi popya nando osha meholamo.
Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.	Omolwashike to pula ndje? Pula aantu mboka yu uvu sho nda popi. Ya pula kutya onde ya lombwele shike, oye shi shi.”
And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?	Jesus sho a popi oohapu ndhika, omumati gumwe gwomaalangeli mboka ya li ya thikama mpoka, okwe mu dhenge olupi e ta ti: “Osho to yamukula omuyambimukuluntu ngawo?”
Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?	Jesus okwe mu yamukula: “Ngele onda popi sha sha puka, lombwela kehe gumwe e li mpaka kutya oshike. Ihe ngele shoka nda popi, oshi li mondjila, oto dhengele ndje shike?”
Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.	Annas okwe mu tumu a mangwa natango kuKajafas, omuyambimukuluntu.
And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.	Petrus okwa li a thikama natango pomulilo ta huhulukwa. Ano mboka ya li taa huhulukwa pamwe naye, oye mu pula ya ti: “Ngoye ku shi gumwe gwomaalongwa yomulumentu ngwiya?” Ihe Petrus okwi idhimbike natango a ti: “Aawe, hangame.”
One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?	Gumwe gwomaamati yomuyambi omukuluntu, omukwanezimo gwomulumentu ngoka Petrus a tetele okutsi, okwa ti: “Ou shi aniwa, inandi ku mona meyana pamwe naye?”
Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.	Natango Petrus okwi idhimbike, nopo tuu mpoka ekondombololo olyi igi.
Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.	Aakwiita oya kutha mo Jesus maandjaKajafas e taye mu fala kaandjaPilatus. Osha ningwa ongula onene. Ihe Aajuda inaa ya mo maandjaPilatus, oshoka oya li ya hala okukala ya yogoka, opo ya wape okulya onzigona yOpaasa.
Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?	Nena Pilatus okwa piti mo, a yi kuyo e ta ti: “Omulumentu nguno otamu mu tamanekele shike?”
They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.	Oyo oye mu yamukula ya ti: “Omulumentu nguka ando okwa li kee shi omukolokoshi, ando inatu mu eta kungoye.”
Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:	Pilatus okwa ti kuyo: “Mu kuthii po e tamu ke mu pangula ne yene pampango yeni.” Aajuda oye mu yamukula ya ti: “Tse otwi indikwa okudhipaga omuntu.”
That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.	Shika osha ningwa, opo oohapu ndhoka dhi gwanithwe Jesus e dhi popi, sho a holola kutya eso ndyoka e na okusa, olya tya ngiini.
Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?	Pilatus okwa shuna megumbo nokwi ithana Jesus e te mu pula ta ti: “Ngoye omukwaniilwa gwAajuda?”
Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?	Jesus okwa yamukula a ti: “Epulo ndika olya zi mungoye mwene, nenge aantu yalwe ya hokolola ndje pungoye?”
Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?	Pilatus okwa yamukula: “Ou shi ngame Omujuda? Aantu yoshigwana shoye naayambi yawo aakuluntu oyo ye ku eta kungame. Owa ningi shike ano?”
Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.	Jesus okwa yamukula a ti: “Uukwaniilwa wandje kau shi womuuyuni mbuka. Ando uukwaniilwa wandje owa li womuuyuni mbuka, ando aantu yandje ya kondjele ndje ndaa gandjwe miikaha yAajuda. Ihe ngashingeyi, uukwaniilwa wandje kau shi waampaka.”
Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.	Pilatus okwe mu pula a ti: “Ngoye omukwaniilwa nani?” Jesus okwe mu yamukula a ti: “Ongoye to ti kutya ngame omukwaniilwa. Osho nda valelwa nonde ya muuyuni mbuka, opo ndi popye oshili. Kehe ngoka ha kala moshili, otu uvu ewi lyandje.”
Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.	Pilatus okwa ti kuye: “Oshili oshike?”Pilatus okwa shuna pondje kAajuda e ta ti kuyo: “Ngame kandi wete nando etompelo lyasha lyoku mu pangulitha.
But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?	Ihe omu na omukalo handi mu mangululile aluhe onkwatwa yimwe pethimbo lyoshituthi shOpaasa. Omwa hala, ndi mu mangululile omukwaniilwa gwAajuda?”
Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.	Oyo oyi igidha ishewe ya ti: “Aawe, haye ngoka! Tse otwa hala Barabbas!” Barabbas okwa li omukolokoshi.
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.	Nena Pilatus okwa kutha Jesus e te mu dhengitha noongola.
And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,	Aakwiita oya tungu oshishani shomakwega noye shi mu zaleke komutse. Oyo oye mu zaleke wo onguwo onene ontiligane.
And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.	Noye ya kuye e taa ti: “Kala u na omwenyo omule, omukwaniilwa gwAajuda!” Opo ihe oye mu dhenge nomalupi.
Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.	Pilatus okwa shuna natango pondje kAajuda e ta ti kuyo. “Taleni, otandi mu eta mpaka pondje pune, opo ndi mu ulukile kutya kandi wete nando etompelo lyasha lyoku mu pangulitha.”
Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!	Jesus okwa piti mo ihe a zalekwa oshishani shomakwega nonguwo ontiligane. Pilatus okwa ti kuyo: “Taleni, omuntu oye ngu.”
When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.	Nena aayambi aakuluntu naalangeli sho ye mu mono, oyi igidha ya ti: “Mu alela komushigakano!” Pilatus okwe ya lombwele a ti: “Mu kuthii po ne yene e tamu mu alele komushigakano, oshoka ngame kandi wete nando etompelo lyoku mu pangulitha.”
The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.	Aajuda oye mu yamukula ya ti: “Tse otu na ompango ndjoka tayi ti: Oku na okusa, oshoka okwi iningi Omuna gwaKalunga.”
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;	Pilatus sho e ya uvu taa popi ngeyi, okwa tila noonkondo shi vulithe nale.
And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.	Oye okwa shuna megumbo lye nokwa pula Jesus a ti: “Owa za peni ano?” Ihe Jesus ine mu yamukula nando osha.
Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?	Pilatus okwa ti kuye: “Ito yamukula ndje? Dhimbulukwa kutya ondi na oonkondo oku ku mangulula nondi na oonkondo oku ku alelitha komushigakano.”
Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.	Jesus okwe mu yamukula a ti: “Ku na oonkondo dhokupangula ndje, ngele ino dhi pewa kuKalunga. Onkee omulumentu ngoka a gandja ndje kungoye, oku na oondjo e ku vule.”
And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.	Pilatus sho u uvu oohapu ndhoka, okwa li a hala noonkondo okumangulula Jesus. Ihe Aajuda oyi igidha ya ti: “Ngele oto mu mangulula, nena otashi ti kutya ku shi kuume komupangeli Omuroma. Oshoka kehe ngoka ti iningi omukwaniilwa, oye omukondjithi gwomupangeli Omuroma.”
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.	Pilatus sho u uvu oohapu ndhoka, okwa fala Jesus pondje e ta kuutumba koshipundi shepangulo pehala hali ithanwa Olupale lwomamanya, mOshihebeli “Gabbata”.
And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!	Ethimbo olya li potundi ontimulongo nambali yomutenya yesiku ndyoka lya tetekela Opaasa. Pilatus okwa ti kAajuda: “Taleni, omukwaniilwa gweni oye nguka!”
But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.	Oyo oyi igidha mokule: “Mu dhipaga, mu dhipaga! Mu alela komushigakano!” Pilatus okwe ya pula a ti: “Omwa hala, ndi alele omukwaniilwa gweni komushigakano?” Aayambi aakuluntu oya yamukula ya ti: “Tse katu na omukwaniilwa a tya ngaaka, kakele komupangeli Omuroma.”
Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.	Nena Pilatus okwa gandja Jesus kuyo, opo a ka alelwe komushigakano.Nena yo oya kutha Jesus.
And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:	Oye okwa piti mo a humbata omushigakano gwe ye mwene e te ya kehala lyi ithanwa “Golgata”, mOshihebeli otali ti “Oshala sholukwe”.
Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.	Oko nkoka ye mu alele komushigakano. Pamwe naye oya alele wo aalumentu yaali komishigakano dhawo, gumwe okolulyo nomukwawo okolumoho naJesus pokati kawo.
And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.	Pilatus okwa nyola enyolo e te li tula komushigakano gwaJesus. Olyo olya li lya nyolwa ngeyi: “Jesus Omunasareti, omukwaniilwa gwAajuda.”
This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.	Aajuda oyendji oya lesha enyolo ndika, oshoka ehala mpoka Jesus a alelwa komushigakano, olya li popepi noshilando. Enyolo olya li lya nyolwa mOshihebeli, mOshilatina nomOshigreka.
Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.	Aayambi aakuluntu Aajuda oya ti kuPilatus: “Ino nyola ‘Omukwaniilwa gwAajuda,’ ihe shila tya: ‘Omulumentu nguka okwa tile: Ongame omukwaniilwa gwAajuda.’ ”
Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.	Pilatus okwa yamukula a ti: “Shoka nda nyola, nda nyola nale.”
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.	Ano aakwiita sho ya alele Jesus komushigakano, oya kutha oonguwo dhe e taa dhi topola miitopolwa ine, kehe omukwiita okwa pewa oshitopolwa shimwe. Oyo oya kutha onguwo yokohi, ya tungwa niikaha yaa na nando omihondjo.
They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.	Nena aakwiita oya lombwelathana ya ti: “Inatu yi kondeni, ihe tu yi umbileni oshihogololitho, opo tu mone kutya otayi ningi yalye.” Shika osha ningwa, opo enyolo li gwanithwe ndyoka tali ti: “Oyo oya topolelathana oonguwo dhandje, omuzalo gwandje oye gu umbile oshihogololitho.” Onkee aakwiita osho ya ningi.
Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.	Ihe popepi nomushigakano gwaJesus opwa li pwa thikama yina nomumwayina omukiintu, Maria, omukiintu gwaKleopas naMaria Magdalena.
When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!	Ano Jesus sho a mono yina nomulongwa ngoka a li e hole, ya thikama mpoka, okwa ti kuyina: “Meme, omumwoye oye ngo!”
Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.	Opo ihe okwa ti komulongwa: “Nyoko oye ngo!” Pethimbo olyo tuu ndyoka omulongwa okwa taamba Maria, a kale megumbo lye.
After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.	Jesus okwa li e shi shi kutya ngashingeyi iinima ayihe oya gwanithwa. Onkee, opo shoka sha nyolwa shi gwanithwe, okwa ti: “Onda sa enota.”
Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.	Okwa li ku na oshuma shu udha omaviinu omalulu. Oyo oya yaya oshisopi momaviinu omalulu e taye shi tula koshihenguti shoshisopi noye shi tsike komilungu dhaJesus.
When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.	Jesus okwa nu omaviinu omalulu e ta ti: “Ayihe ya gwanithwa!” Opo ihe okwa sizimike omutse gwe e ta si.
The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.	Nena Aajuda oyi indile Pilatus, e ya pitikile okuteyagula oohongo dhaalumentu mboka ya alelwa, opo ya kuthwe ko komishigakano. Shika oye shi ningi molwashoka esiku ndyoka olya li Etitano, yo oya li inaaya hala, omidhimba dhi kale dhe endjelela komishigakano mEsabati, oshoka Esabati ndyoka olya li lya simana.
Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.	Aakwiita oya yi e taa teyagula oohongo dhomulumentu ngoka gwotango, opo ihe dhomukwawo omutiyali, aalumentu mboka ya li ya alelwa pamwe naJesus.
But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:	Ihe sho ye ya kuJesus, oya dhimbulula kutya okwa sa nale nokuli, onkee inaa teyagula nando oohongo dhe.
But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.	Opo ihe gumwe okwa tsu Jesus negonga molupati, omo nomwa zi ombinzi nomeya.
And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.	Ngoka a mono shika, sho tashi ningwa, oye e shi hokolola. Tse otu shi shi kutya shoka ta popi, oshoshili, naye mwene wo oku shi shi kutya ota popi oshili, opo nane wo mu itaale.
For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.	Shika osha ningwa, opo enyolo li gwanithwe ndyoka tali ti: “Kaku na nando esipa lye tali ka teyagulwa.”
And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.	Enyolo ekwawo ishewe otali ti: “Aantu otaa ka tala kunguka ye mu ulula.”
And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.	Konima yaambika Josef, ngoka a za koshilando shaArimatia, okwa pula Pilatus, ngele otashi vulika, a pewe omudhimba gwaJesus. Josef okwa li omulongwa gwaJesus, ihe omeholamo, oshoka okwa tila Aajuda. Pilatus okwe mu zimine. Oye nokwa yi nagwo.
And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.	Nikodemus ngoka i ile kuJesus uusiku, okwe ya pamwe naJosef e na omugwayo gwomagadhi ga nika nawa, gu thike puudhigu wookilo omulongo nambali.
Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.	Aalumentu mbaka yaali oya kutha omudhimba gwaJesus e taye gu mangele momalapi omatokele mumwe niizimba. Nguka ogwo omukalo gwAajuda gwokulongekidhila omudhimba efumviko.
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.	Pehala mpoka Jesus a alelwa komushigakano, opwa li pu na eyana. Meyana ndyoka omwa li mu na ombila ompe, moka inaamu fumvikwa nando omuntu.
There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.	Molwashoka olya li esiku lya tetekela Esabati lyAajuda nomolwashoka wo ombila oya li popepi, oya fumvike Jesus mombila ndjoka.
The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.	Ongula onene yesiku lyotango lyoshiwike, manga kwa luudha natango, Maria Magdalena okwa yi kombila nokwa mono kutya emanya olya kandulwa po posheelo.
Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.	Oye okwa matuka e ta yi kuSimon Petrus nokomulongwa mukwawo ngoka Jesus kwa li e hole nokwe ya lombwele a ti: “Oyo oya kutha mo Omuwa mombila, natse katu shi wo mpoka ye mu tula!”
Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.	Nena Petrus nomulongwa mukwawo oya yi ihe kombila.
So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.	Ayehe yaali oya ningi shanamutango, ihe omulongwa ngoka mukwawo okwa thigi po Petrus e ta thiki tango kombila.
And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.	Oye okwa ontamene mo e ta mono omalapi omatokele, ihe ina ya mo.
Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,	Simon Petrus okwe ya wo e mu landula nokwa thikile u ukilila mombila. Oyo okwa mono mo omalapi omatokele ge li mo.
And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.	Nelapi ndyoka lya li lya manga omutse gwaJesus, lya gonywa li ikalela pehala lyalyo.
Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.	Nena nomulongwa mukwawo ngoka a thiki tango kombila, okwa yi wo mombila nokwa mono e ti itaale.
For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.	Oshoka natango tuu oya li kaa uvite ko enyolo ndyoka tali ti: “Oye okwa li e na okuyumudhwa kuusi.”
Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.	Nena aalongwa oya shuna kaandjawo.
But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,	Maria okwa kala a thikama pombila pondje ta lili. Ano sho ta lili ngeyi, okwa ontamene mo mombila
And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.	nokwa mono mo aayengeli yaali ya zala oonguwo oontokele ya kuutumba mpoka pwa li pwa lala omudhimba gwaJesus, gumwe okomutse nomukwawo okomagulu.
And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.	Oyo oye mu pula: “Nekulu, omolwashike to lili?” Maria okwe ya yamukula a ti: “Aantu oya kutha mo Omuwa gwandje mombila, ngame inandi tseya mpoka ye mu tula.”
And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.	Sho a popi ngeyi, okwa punguluka e ta tala lwanima nokwa mono Jesus a thikama mpoka. Ihe okwa li kee shi shi kutya oye Jesus.
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.	Nena Jesus okwe mu pula: “Nekulu, omolwashike to lili? Oto kongo lye?” Maria okwa dhiladhila kutya ngiika omwene gweyana nokwa ti kuye: “Tatekulu, ngele ongoye we mu kutha mo, lombwela ndje nkoka we mu tula, ndi ke mu tale ko.”
Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.	Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Maria!” Maria okwa pungulukile kuye e ta popi mOshihebeli ta ti: “Rabbi,” otashi ti Muhongi.
Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.	Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Ino guma ndje, oshoka inandi londa natango, ndi ye kuTate. Ihe inda kaamwameme e to ya lombwele kutya ngame otandi shuna kuTate, nokuKalunga kandje nokeni wo.”
Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.	Nena Maria Magdalena okwa yi nokwa lombwele aalongwa kutya okwa mono Omuwa, ngoka e mu lombwele oohapu ndhoka.
Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.	Ongulohi yesiku tuu ndyoka lyotango lyoshiwike omiyelo dhongulu moka aalongwa ya li ya gongala, odha li dha patwa, oshoka oya li ya tila Aajuda. Nena Jesus okwe ya nokwa thikama mokati kawo e ta ti kuyo: “Ombili nayi kale nane!”
And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.	Sho a popi ngeyi, okwe ya ulukile iikaha ye nolupati lwe. Aalongwa oya nyanyukwa noonkondo, sho ya mono Omuwa.
Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.	Jesus okwa ti ishewe kuyo: “Ombili nayi kale nane! Ngashi naanaa Tate a tumu ndje, osho wo nangame otandi mu tumu.”
And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:	Oye okwa popi ndhika nokwe ya fudhile e te ya lombwele ta ti: “Taambeni Ombepo Ondjapuki.
Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.	Mboka tamu ya dhimine po oondjo, oyo oya dhiminwa po, naamboka itaamu ya dhimine po, inaa dhiminwa po.”
But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.	Gumwe gwomaalongwa, Tomas, ngoka i ithanwa Mukwanambwiyu, ina adhika mo mokati kawo, Jesus sho e yi ihololele.
The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.	Aalongwa ooyakwawo oye mu lombwele ya ti: “Tse otwa mono Omuwa.” Tomas okwa ti kuyo: “Ngele itandi mono iishaho yoomboha miikaha ye noitandi tsu omunwe gwandje moombululu moka mwa li oomboha, noshikaha shandje shi tse molupati lwe, itandi itaale.”
And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.	Omasiku gahetatu sho ga piti po, aalongwa oya adhika ishewe ya gongala mongulu, naTomas okwa li pamwe nayo. Omiyelo odha li dha patekeka, ihe Jesus okwe ya nokwa thikama mokati kawo e ta ti: “Ombili nayi kale nane!”
Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.	Opo ihe okwa lombwele Tomas a ti: “Ukitha omunwe gwoye nkuka, ngoye u tale iikaha yandje: Ganeka oshikaha shoye, u gume olupati lwandje. Za mo ihe momalimbililo, u itaale.”
And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.	Tomas okwe mu yamukula a ti: “Omuwa gwandje! Kalunga kandje!”
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.	Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Owi itaale, sho wa mono ndje. Aanelago oomboka yi itaala, nando inaa mona ndje.”
And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:	Jesus okwa longo iikumithalonga yilwe oyindji montaneho yaalongwa ye, mbyoka inaayi nyolelwa mo membo ndika.
But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.	Ihe mbika oya nyolwa, opo mu itaale kutya Jesus oye Kristus, Omuna gwaKalunga, nongele mwi itaala, otamu mono omwenyo molwe.
After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.	Konima yaambika Jesus okwi ihololele ishewe aalongwa ye pefuta lyaTiberias. Oye okwi iholola ngeyi.
There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.	Simon Petrus, Tomas, ngoka i ithanwa Mukwanambwiyu, Natanael gwomuKana shomuGalilea, aana yaSebedeus naalongwa ooyakwawo yaJesus yaali opo ya li ayehe.
Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.	Simon Petrus okwa ti kuyo: “Otandi yi, ndi ka yule oohi.” Oyo oye mu yamukula ya ti: “Natse wo otwa hala okuya nangoye.” Oyo oya thikama e taa yi mowato, ihe muusiku mbwiyaka auhe inaa kwata mo nando osha.
But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.	Ano ongula sho kwa shi, Jesus okwa thikama komunkulo, ihe aalongwa oya li inaaye mu dhimbulula.
Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.	Opo Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Aamati yandje, inamu kwata mo nando osha?” Oyo oye mu yamukula ya ti: “Aawe!”
And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.	Jesus okwe ya lombwele: “Umbileni oshiyulitho sheni lwokolulyo lwowato, notamu ka mona sha.” Oyo oyu umbile mo oshiyulitho noya nyengwa oku shi hila mo, oshoka oya li ya yula oohi odhindji.
Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.	Omulongwa ngoka Jesus kwa li e hole, okwa lombwele Petrus a ti: “Omuwa oye ngo!” Simon Petrus sho u uvu kutya oye Omuwa, okwa zala ombaikitha ye, oshoka okwa li a zala oonguwo dhokohi adhike e ta nukile momeya.
And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.	Aalongwa ooyakwawo oye ya nowato komunkulo noya hili mo oshiyulitho, shoka shu udha oohi. Oyo kaya li unene kokule nevi, oya li poshikako shi thike poometa ethele.
As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.	Ano sho ya thiki komunkulo, oya mono eziko lyomulilo gwa teka ekala, nopeziko opwa li pu na oohi noshikwiila.
Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.	Nena Jesus okwe ya lombwele a ti: “Eteni oohi dhimwe nkuka, ndhoka mwe dhi kwata ngashingeyi.”
Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.	Simon Petrus okwa yi ihe mowato, e ta hilile oshiyulitho komunkulo. Sho osha li shu udha oohi oonene, ethele limwe nomilongo ntano nandatu. Ihe nando oohi odha li mo odhindji ngeyi, oshiyulitho inashi tomoka nando.
Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.	Jesus okwa ti kuyo: “Ileni, tu lyeni.” Kape na nando ogumwe gwomaalongwa ngoka a li e na omukumo oku mu pula kutya ongoye lye? Oshoka yo oya li ye shi shi kutya oye Omuwa.
Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.	Jesus okwe ya e ta kutha oshikwiila nokwe shi ya pe; noohi wo osho a ningi.
This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.	Nduka olutitatu, sho Jesus i ihololele aalongwa ye konima yeyumuko lye kuusi.
So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.	Ano sho ya mana okulya, Jesus okwa ti kuSimon Petrus: “Simon yaJohannes, ou hole ndje tuu u vule mbaka?” Oye okwe mu yamukula: “Eeno, Omuwa, ou shi shi kutya ondi ku hole.” Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Litha uunzigona wandje.”
He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.	Jesus okwa ti kuye olutiyali: “Simon yaJohannes, ou hole ndje?” Oye okwe mu yamukula: “Eeno, Omuwa, ou shi shi kutya ondi ku hole.” Jesus okwe mu lombwele: “Litha oonzi dhandje.”
He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.	Jesus okwa ti kuye olutitatu: “Simon yaJohannes, ou hole ndje?” Petrus okwa nika oluhodhi, Jesus sho e mu pula olutitatu: “Ou hole ndje?” e ta ti kuye: “Omuwa, owa tseya iinima ayihe; ou shi shi kutya ondi ku hole.” Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Litha oonzi dhandje.
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.	Ngame otandi ku lombwele oshili: Sho wa li omunona, owa li ho imanga epaya mombunda, nowa yi shaa mpoka wa hala, ihe nge wa koko, nena oto yelutha omaako goye, gulwe note ku manga e te ku fala nkoka inoo hala okuya ko.”
This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.	Shika okwe shi popi, opo a holole kutya oneso lya tya ngiini Petrus e na oku ka simanekitha Kalunga. Nena Jesus okwa ti kuye: “Landula ndje.”
Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?	Petrus okwa punguluka e ta tala lwanima, nokwa mono omulongwa mukwawo, ngoka Jesus kwa li e hole. Oye tuu ngoka a li a kuutumba ponto yaJesus puulalelo nokwa pulile Jesus ta ti: “Omuwa, olye ngoka te ke ku gwaaleka?”
Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?	Petrus sho e mu mono, okwa ti kuJesus: “Omuwa, ongiini kombinga yomulumentu nguka.”
Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.	Jesus okwe mu yamukula: “Ngele onda hala, a kale e na omwenyo, sigo tandi ya, ou na shike nasho? Landula ndje ashike.”
Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?	Ehokololo olya taandele ihe mokati kaalongwa yaJesus kutya omulongwa ngoka ita si. Jesus ina tya kutya ita si, ihe okwa ti: “Ngame ngele onda hala, a kale e na omwenyo, sigo tandi ya, ou na shike nasho?”
This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.	Omulongwa ngoka oye tuu nguka ta hokolola iinima mbika, noye wo ngoka e yi nyola. Tse notu shi shi kutya shoka ta ti, osho oshili.
And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.	Ano oku na iinima iikwawo oyindji Jesus e yi ninga. Ando ayihe oya nyolelwe shimwe nashimwe, ondi inekela, ando omambo ngoka itaga gwana mo muuyuni.
